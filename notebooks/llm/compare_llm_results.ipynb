We will be using a plastic lid. You also need a lighter, and a lighter fluid. You can use a small piece of paper and some kerosene. You will also need some red chalk. And some glue.\\n\\nMethod:\\n\\n  * Pour some kerosene on the lighter, put the lighter in the tin and put the can in the tin. \\n  * Add a few drops of kerosene. Add the lid and put the tin and the lid in the container.\\n  \\xa0The fire should be on low or medium heat, in a small amount of oil.\\n  \\xa0\\nThis is a great opportunity to have a look at the results of the previous activity. If you have not done so already, please go to the section about the laboratory and take a look at the lab 4.1. This should have been performed on a different date.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn the final stages of the project we are going to make a fire. This activity is very important as the results of the final activity of the project will depend on the fire. Therefore, the results of the project are important.
