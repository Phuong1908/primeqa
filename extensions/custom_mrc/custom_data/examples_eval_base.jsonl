{"question":"Do zebra finches have stripes?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"passage_indices":[-1,5,-1],"start_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","YES","NONE"]},"context":["\nThe zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)[2] is the most common estrildid finch of Central Australia and ranges over most of the continent, avoiding only the cool moist south and some areas of the tropical far north. It can also be found natively in Indonesia and East Timor. The bird has been introduced to Puerto Rico and Portugal.[1]\nTaxonomy and phylogeny\nThe zebra finch was first collected in 1801 during Nicolas Baudin's expedition to Australia. It was described in 1817 by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in his Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle, where he gave it the scientific name Fringilla guttata. The Australian subspecies was then described in 1837 by John Gould as Amadina castanotis.[3] Its current genus, Taeniopygia, was described in 1862 by Ludwig Reichenbach.[4] It is placed in the tribe Poephilini,[5] along with the genus Poephila, which it was previously included in;[6] the split between Taeniopygia and Poephila is justified by 1987 study using protein electrophoresis and chromosomal banding.[7]\nThere are two subspecies of the zebra finch:\nTaeniopygia guttata guttata, the Timor zebra finch, extends from Lombok in the Lesser Sunda Islands or Nusa Tenggara in Indonesia to Sermata, in addition to coastal areas around the continent of Australia.\nTaeniopygia guttata castanotis is found over the wide range of continental Australia; it is sometimes split as the Australian zebra finch.[8]\n\n\n\nThe zebra finch likely evolved in Australia, with either northern or southeastern Australia postulated as two places where the genus arose. The present-day distribution of the subspecies T. g. guttata is likely due to a Pleistocene glaciation event where the sea level dropped between about 100 and 150 metres (330 and 490ft), putting the coasts of Timor and Australia closer. This allowed birds swept out to sea by cyclones to see mountains near the west coast of Timor, which prompted them to make landfall on the island.[9]\nThe morphological differences between the subspecies include differences in size. T. g. guttata is smaller than T. g. castanotis. In addition, the T. g. guttata males do not have the fine barring found on the throat and upper breast and have smaller breast bands.[10]\nHabitat and distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe zebra finch has the most extensive mainland distribution of the Australian estrilids, being found in about 75% of mainland Australia, as the subspecies Taeniopygia guttata castanotis. This subspecies is generally not found on the coasts, except for the arid western edge.[11] As the subspecies T. g. guttata, it is distributed from the islands Lombok and Sumbawa in the Lesser Sundas east to Luang and Sermata, and south to Sumba, Sawu, Dao, Roti, Semau, and Timor.[10]\nThe zebra finch (or at the very least, the subspecies T. g. castanotis) is generally found in more arid areas.[8] The areas it chooses to occupy are close to water, and places where rain is concentrated after it falls.[12] However, this is likely more related to the abundance of vegetation than the abundance of water as a resource in itself.[13]. Within these areas, it is found in grasslands with scattered trees and shrubs, and in open or grassy woodlands.[8] It is also found in cultivated areas,[14] such as rice fields[10] It usually stays confined to the low coastal areas of the islands it inhabits, but it can move to elevations up to 2,300 metres (7,500ft) to exploit expanding cultivation and grasslands.[15]\nAlthough zebra finch breeding, for example, is initiated by rainfall,[16] Klaus Immelmann proposed that sustained heavy precipitation is detrimental to the zebra finch. This is supported by the observation that the nest does not shield the chicks or eggs from rain, and rainfall can sometimes result in clutches being abandoned. Furthermore, it is supported by Immelmann's finding that zebra finches left Wyndham after the first heavy rains in November 1959, but returned to breed in April. It is hypothesized that birds in parts of northern Australia migrate inland during the wet season from October to May, and return to the coastal regions during the dryer months.[17]\nLife cycle\nThe life expectancy of a zebra finch is highly variable because of genetic and environmental factors. The zebra finch may reach up to five years in its natural environment. If they are kept caged, they normally live for 5 to 9 years but may live as long as 12 years,[18] with an exceptional case of 14.5 years reported for a caged specimen.[19] The greatest threats to zebra finch survival are predation by cats and loss of natural food.[20]\nSong and other vocalizations\nZebra finches are loud and boisterous singers. Their calls can be a loud beep, meep, oi! or a-ha!. Their song is a few small beeps, leading up to a rhythmic song of varying complexity in males. Each male's song is different, although birds of the same bloodline will exhibit similarities, and all finches will overlay their own uniqueness onto a common rhythmic framework. Sons generally learn the song of their fathers with little variation. There is a critical sensitive period during which juvenile males learn their songs by imitating a mature, male tutor.[21] Subsong (early, poorly structured vocalizations) evolve into 'plastic song'. This plastic song is variable between renditions but begins to incorporate some recognizable elements of tutor songs.[21] A study conducted by Nottebohm et al., has shown that birds were able to successfully imitate their tutor\u2019s song after relatively short exposure (40 playbacks of the motifs lasting 30 seconds total) over the duration of their sensitive learning period.[22] These birds eventually form a \u201ctemplate\u201d of what their correct song should sound like. They rely on auditory feedback for both song learning and practice as juveniles and song maintenance as adults. Adult birds maintain their songs by correcting any deviations from their target song template. During adulthood, by around 90 days, the bird's song goes through a crystallization phase where their song template is stable and it no longer changes.[21]\nMale zebra finches begin to sing at puberty, while females lack a singing ability.[18] This is due to a developmental difference, where in the embryo, the male zebra finch produces testosterone, which is transformed into estradiol in the brain, which in turn leads to the development of the nervous system for a song system.[23] There are multiple areas of the brain involved in the production of song. When a bird is singing a learned song, the HVC projects to the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), which itself projects to the hypoglossal motoneurons. These motoneurons control the muscles of the trachea and syrinx. When learning a new song, the HVC sends efferents to Area X in the lobus parolfactorius, which connects to the medial nucleus of the dorsolateral thalamus (DLM). This structure connects to the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN), which projects to the RA, and continues like a normal learned song would. The function of the various areas involved in learning is still being investigated.[24] Area X is likely involved in the acquisition of a new song,[25] whereas the LMAN likely serves a key role in the plasticity necessary for learning.[24] Activation of song behavior later depends on androgens.[26]\nBecause zebra finch males learn their songs from their surroundings, they are often used as avian model organisms to investigate the neural bases of learning, memory, and sensorimotor integration. For example, studies have investigated the role of FoxP2 in song learning and have found that in young finches both knockdown and overexpression of FoxP2 in the striatal song control nucleus, Area X, prevents accurate song learning and tutor imitation.[27][28] These studies also have implications for human speech. Individuals heterozygous for a point mutation in FOXP2 manifest a speech disorder.[29] Because of similar expression patterns between humans and songbirds, the zebra finch is used as a model to study FoxP2 expression and function.[30] The zebra finch genome was the second bird genome to be sequenced, in 2008, after that of the chicken.[31]\nThe zebra finch uses an acoustic signal to communicate to embryos. It gives an incubation call to its eggs when the weather is hot\u2014above 26\u00b0C (79\u00b0F)\u2014and when the end of their incubation period is near. This call alters the growth and behaviour of the chicks, with chicks that were given an incubation call having less mass at the end of the nestling phase when they experienced higher nest temperatures. This contrasts with chicks that were not given an incubation call, which have a higher mass at the end of nestling after being exposed to high nest temperatures. Additionally, the chicks called to as an embryo are more likely to call after experiencing high nest temperatures.[32]\nCalling behaviour is used by zebra finches to negotiate parental care duties. In an experiment that delayed the return of the males to the nest, it was found that the resulting duets were shorter and calls were made more often.[33] This is the first species that vocal negotiation over parental care has ever been reported.[34]\nBehaviour\nBreeding\n\n\nThe zebra finch generally breeds in loose colonies of up to 50 nests (although the number of individuals in a colony can be up to about 230 when breeding, and around 350 when not), but it may nest solitarily.[14] It often does not breed in the colony it was born; of the ringed birds that bred in the Danaher breeding colony () from 1985 to 1989, 24% of them were hatched from the colony or in the immediate vicinity. Additionally, natal dispersal is not sex-biased, unlike in most passerines. However, males between 36 and 50 days of age are more likely to disperse than females, although after this age, more females disperse than males.[35] Predation is likely a major factor in coloniality; nests in the main colony suffer less predation than nests further away. Pairs with preyed-upon nests are significantly more likely to nest in a bush more than 20 metres (66ft) away from their previous nesting plant.[36] Another large factor is where others nest: individuals are more likely to nest closer to conspecifics. In addition, reproductive success of conspecifics may play a role in where individuals nest; a study published in 2012 found that this finch was more likely to breed near nests with chicks older than six days (used as a proxy for reproductive success because they fledge about 87% of the time).[37] The zebra finch usually places its nest in a thorny shrub or tree, although it will nest in other structures, natural and artificial.[14] Often, there are multiple nests in one shrub.[8]\nThe zebra finch builds both a roosting and breeding nest. The former is dome-shaped and has a large entrance on the side. This contrasts with the small entrance that conceals the inside of the latter nest. The breeding nest is also lined with soft material, such as wool and feathers.[38] Both sites are defended during the day; however, while a desperate bird is sometimes let in to the roosting nest during the night, the breeding nest is always guarded.[39]\nThe zebra finch is an opportunistic breeder, initiating reproductive behaviour about one to three months after water becomes available. This is so that the young hatch when semi-ripe and ripe seeds (their primary food) become available. This finding is in line with the food quality hypothesis of zebra finch breeding, which states that dry grass seed is inadequate as a food source for nestlings, and that higher quality food (like ripening seeds) is needed to sustain them.[16] Thus, in captivity, it can breed year round when provided with sufficient water,[40] and it may attempt to breed several times per breeding season.[41] Zebra finches form socially monogamous pair bonds that remain stable for at least the duration of raising a clutch, but can last for up to several years. Extra-pair copulation, mating with individuals other than one's mate, occurs occasionally, with females usually soliciting it.[42] Extra-pair parentage is relatively rare in the wild, accounting for about 2% of young.[43][44] Attempts at forced extra-pair copulations by males occur frequently (about 43.8% of the time in one study); but, females can always successfully resist forced copulations if they so choose.[45]\n\nThere are multiple hypotheses as to why extra-pair copulation might have evolved.[46] One theory is the good genes theory, which states that a female chooses extra-pair copulation if the extra-pair male grants its offspring direct benefits as a result of the male's alleles.[47] There are results that seem to support this; a 1992 study found a correlation between the song rate of a male and the attractiveness of it (measured on the basis of how much time the female spent with the male).[42] However, a 2007 study found that the responsiveness of a female (measured by behaviours indicating an intent to copulate or rejection) was not significantly related to the male's beak colour or its song rate. Song rate was instead hypothesized to draw female's attention to males. According to the author, this meant that the validity of the conclusions of the 1992 experiment needed to be reexamined.[45] Combined with the lack of influence that certain morphological traits have, the large control of females over copulation could indicate chase-away sexual selection,[48] where an exaggerated trait is evolved to counter increased resistance by the female to that feature.[49] An additional theory as to why extra-pair copulation might evolve is the between-sex genetic correlation theory. This theory is based on the lack of definite female benefits in extra-pair copulations, and the benefits that males have by being promiscuous. It states that extra-pair mating behaviour could arise from the same set of loci, and thus that strong selection for extra-pair mating behaviour would indirectly select for promiscuous behaviour in females.[46]\n\nThere are several traits correlated with increased extra-pair copulations. Spending time with a mate is important; even more important than the attractiveness of a male (as judged by other females; attractiveness as judged by one female was positively correlated with the judgements of other females).[45] Symmetry of both plumage, like chest bands, and artificial features, like leg bands, are preferred by the female, as measured by how often the male is displayed to.[50] Because of the prevalence of extra-pair paternity, males have evolved various mechanisms to try and assure their paternity of a clutch. The male guards its mate by following it and stopping extra-pair copulation attempts. Sperm competition, where two or more males attempt to inseminate a single egg, also occurs. This is indicated by the male in a pair copulating with its mate more often the day before egg-starts. This is because the last male to copulate with a female before the next egg has a 70% to 80% chance of fertilizing the egg in question.[51] Another adaptation to sperm competition is the male ejaculating up to seven times more sperm in extra-pair copulations. The increased amount of sperm occurs because of the combination of ejaculate size being controlled by the time between previous copulations, and the fact that extra-pair copulations occur in the male after its period of within-pair copulation period is complete.[52]\nThe number of eggs ranges from two to eight eggs per clutch, with five being the most common number.[53] These eggs are white or pale greyish blue in colour, and have a size of about 16 by 10 millimetres (0.63 by 0.39in). They are incubated for 14 to 16 days.[40] From about 5%[43] to 11% of offspring are the result of intraspecific brood parasitism, and in cases of parasitism, there is usually only one parasitic egg per nest. Additionally, parasitized nests often have one more egg than non-parasitized nests.[44] The female may follow a mixed strategy with relation to brood parasitism (being parasitic in addition to incubating its own clutch). From about 32% to 58% of females do this, and almost all (about 96%) lay parasitic eggs before incubating their clutch. Unpaired females sometimes lay parasitic eggs, but paired females do not rely solely on parasitism. A female that parasitized a nest in the past is more likely to do so in the future. Most of these eggs are unsuccessful; that is, the host abandons its otherwise empty nest after a parasitic egg is laid. Additionally, successful parasites are more likely to have future success from parasitism.[41] At least during late incubation, the female zebra finch can distinguish its own eggs on the basis of odour. This method of distinction arises from the visual similarity between parasitic and non-parasitic eggs, and the cost associated with raising an egg other than one's own.[54] When a bird is parasitized during a nesting attempt, it is less likely to be parasitized again during that season and, at the very least, during the next season (although this could be statistical noise).[41]\nYoung zebra finches fledge about 17 to 18 days after hatching.[8] They feed themselves by around 35 days after hatching, although they are still socially dependent on their parents during this time; the young become socially dependent between 36 and 50 days after hatching. They also develop sexually dimorphic plumage during this period. Birds first attempt to form pair bonds and breed when they get close to 80 days in age. 80 days after hatching, most birds can breed.[35]\nMales and females are very similar in size, but are easily distinguished from one another after reaching maturity, as the males usually have bright orange cheek feathers, red beaks (as opposed to the orange beaks of females), and generally more striking black and white patterns.[20]\nInbreeding\nInbreeding causes early death (inbreeding depression) in the zebra finch, although it does not seem to affect fertility. Embryos have a much lower survival rate, with a study finding fertile eggs from sibling pairs had only about a 25% survival rate, compared to about 41% for unrelated pairs. This early difference in survival eventually becomes null after fledging, with about equal survival rates for offspring from both sibling and unrelated pairs.[55] Inbreeding depression mostly arises due to the expression of deleterious recessive alleles.[56]\nDiet\nThe zebra finch is primarily eats grass seeds,[10] feeding mostly on semi-ripe and ripe seeds (although it also takes dry seeds[16]). The seeds are all dehusked,[57] and are found on stems and the ground, with most being taken, at least in the nominate subspecies, from the latter.[8] The grasses they are taken from are commonly between about 1 and 2.6 millimetres (0.039 and 0.102in) in length,[58] and larger and easily dehusked seeds are preferred.[59] It supplements its diet with insects[8] (mainly ants and termites) caught in short flights from lookout perches,[60] in addition to flowers of the genus Chenopodium.[58] The nestlings diet consists almost entirely of half-ripe[8] and ripe seeds, in addition to green plant material.[16] There are two main reasons why grass seeds are the dietary staple of the zebra finch: they are an abundant and relatively stable food source in this finch's preferred climate, and they are convenient to, for example, dehusk.[61] In some areas, such as the eastern arid zone in Australia, the seeds taken are consistent, whereas in others, like northern Victoria, there are annual changes in the diet, as different species become abundant.[60] The diet of this finch is generally low in species diversity; at Sandringham, Queensland 74% of the seeds eaten over a 15 month period were from Panicum decompositum, for example.[62]\nThe zebra finch generally forages for seeds on the ground, taking them individually. But, it also eats seeds on the heads of standing grass. To do this, it either flies and pecks out seeds one at a time, or it perches on a nearby branch. It may also take the head to the ground by jumping up and seizing it with its bill or feet. In times of scarcity, the zebra finch can use its bill to dig into the ground to find buried seed.[63] These seeds are generally taken from patches which have fewer husks (when compared to the number of whole seeds) and are larger and more dense. A seed patch may be checked for many months after its supply of seed is depleted. Additionally, colonial roosting and nesting and foraging in flocks can help birds discover new patches of seed.[64]\nThis bird commonly forages in flocks, although it sometimes forages in pairs or by itself.[10] In the breeding season, small or medium sized flocks are common, but in the non-breeding season, flocks of up to about 500 birds may be formed. It occasionally forms mixed-species flocks with other estrildids.[8] A feeding flock can be formed by individuals joining those already feeding, or by individuals landing on the ground together. Birds that arrive in this flock later are more likely to rely on scrounging, or taking food from competitors, whereas early arrivals are more likely to find food for themselves. Individuals that tend to explore more may be more dominant (measured by factors such as in what order individuals accessed a food source[65]), at least in a study that had relatively low food availability and a single source where food could be taken from. These individuals may also be less successful in a scramble competition, where there are multiple points where food can be found. The reason for the latter is hypothesized to be a result of a trade-off between faster speed in sampling an area and lower accuracy in detecting seeds.[66]\nForaging activity in the zebra finch peaks in the first hour after sunrise and the second to last hour before sunset. In the first instance, the increase foraging is generally achieved through many short bouts of foraging, whereas the latter comes from a few long bouts.[67] When food becomes less available, like from August to September in northern Victoria, there is more feeding in the afternoon, less time spent on patches of food before leaving, and the distance between places where food is available is longer.[60] There are generally two groups of individuals based on foraging behaviour. In the first group, the probability of starting or stopping a feeding bout is constant through time, and short meals are more usual. Most birds in this group have longer bouts when the gap between the previous bout is longer. In the second group (which may consist of more birds), the longer a gap is, the more likely the individual is to start feeding again. Additionally, for most birds in this group, the same is true of the stopping of a bout; the longer it is, the more likely it is to be stopped. Feeding is also usually cyclical for the second group.[67]\nDrinking and bathing\nThe zebra finch generally consumes about 24% to 28% of its body weight (or about 3 millilitres (0.11impfloz; 0.10USfloz)) in water per day at a temperature of 22 to 23\u00b0C (72 to 73\u00b0F). When at a higher temperature of 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), it may drink from 6 to 12 millilitres (0.21 to 0.42impfloz; 0.20 to 0.41USfloz) of water per day. The zebra finch also extracts water from seeds, and can get water from metabolizing its food. This metabolic water consumption can equal the amount of water that is lost when temperatures are below 23\u00b0C (73\u00b0F), although only for birds that are gradually dehydrated. Suddenly dehydrated birds must be in temperatures below 12\u00b0C (54\u00b0F) before the water lost is equal to that produced by the metabolism. This finch can survive periods of low water consumption; one study that gradually reduced the amount of water given over a period of a few months to just 0.5 to 1 millilitre (0.018 to 0.035impfloz; 0.017 to 0.034USfloz) per week at temperatures from 22 to 24\u00b0C (72 to 75\u00b0F) found that the zebra finch could survive these conditions. Additionally, more than half of birds survived in a total water deprivation experiment that ran 513 days long.[13]\nWhen water is close, the zebra finch drinks regularly during the day; if it is over about 5 kilometres (3.1mi) away, visits generally peak at midday. It prefers to drink from small puddles or other collections of water, especially those with gently sloped banks. Additionally, exposed drinking areas are preferred to more enclosed ones. It can also drink from dew on the tip of leaves. Due to the danger of predation, the zebra finch gathers in flocks in a bush or tree near a waterhole, only going to drink after the group is large enough. It then only drinks for a few seconds. After drinking, the zebra finch generally bathes for around a minute. Then, it dries off and re-oils its plumage in a warm sheltered spot.[13]\nThe zebra finch only needs an average of 3.6 seconds to drink 1.5 millilitres (0.053impfloz; 0.051USfloz) of water. This short amount of time per bout is achieved by this finch's drinking method. It swallows the water it gets while its bill tip is still submerged, unlike most birds that bring their bill tip up to swallow. This unique action is accomplished by having the tongue scoop water into the pharynx. Then, the front of the larynx forces the water into the oesophagus, which, through peristalsis, takes the fluid to the crop. This method could have evolved because the adaptations necessary were already there because of the need to quickly dehusk and swallow seeds. It allows for water to be drunk faster and taken from more diverse sources, such as drops of dew[68][69] and cattle troughs; the latter requires the bird to drink upside down.[69]\nTemperature regulation\nThe body temperature (as measured from the cloaca) of the zebra finch may vary from 38 to 44\u00b0C (100 to 111\u00b0F), rising with increasing air temperatures. Body temperatures over 45\u00b0C (113\u00b0F) can cause death within an hour. This finch first cools itself by covering its plumage with water, not moving, and holding its wings out to allow more thinly feathered regions to be exposed.[70] It also has a large capacity for evaporative cooling through the lungs and skin, with measurements of heat lost through evaporative cooling over heat produced being as high as 1.37 at 43.4\u00b0C (110.1\u00b0F).[71] This can occur as a result of panting, which starts to occur when body temperatures reach 42 to 43\u00b0C (108 to 109\u00b0F) (although this may start when the air temperature is as low as 32\u00b0C (90\u00b0F)). This can cause dehydration and may put birds into a lethargic state.[70] Additionally, the zebra finch's simple rete mirabile ophthalmicum (found in the head) makes it unable to cool the brain as effectively as other birds, like the common kestrel. This lacking ability to cool the brain, in combination with dehydration, may cause the mass die-offs found during prolonged periods of high temperatures.[72] For example, in January 1932, temperatures were between 47 and 52\u00b0C (117 and 126\u00b0F) for 16 days in northern Southern Australia, causing upwards of tens of thousands of this bird to die, with many being found in dams.[70]\nPredators\nNest predators of the zebra finch include the tiger snake, brown snake, dragon lizard, pygmy mulga monitor, singing honeyeater, grey-crowned babbler, yellow-throated miner, little crow, Torresian crow, black rat, and house mouse. Canivorous marsupials are also nest predators, and barn owls take roosting adult zebra finches.[36]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n Media related to Taeniopygia guttata at Wikimedia Commons\n\n on the Internet Bird Collection\n\nView the  in Ensembl\nView the  genome assembly in the UCSC Genome Browser.\n Housing and husbandry for zebra finches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"9ab6f735-c182-4d84-b2f7-c950d7e1fb01"}

In undamaged skin, the epidermis (surface layer) and dermis (deeper layer) form a protective barrier against the external environment. When the barrier is broken, a regulated sequence of biochemical events is set into motion to repair the damage.[1][2] This process is divided into predictable phases: blood clotting (hemostasis), inflammation, tissue growth (proliferation), and tissue remodeling (maturation). Blood clotting may be considered to be part of the inflammation stage instead of a separate stage.[3] \nThe wound healing process is not only complex but also fragile, and it is susceptible to interruption or failure leading to the formation of non-healing chronic wounds. Factors that contribute to non-healing chronic wounds are diabetes, venous or arterial disease, infection, and metabolic deficiencies of old age.[4]\nWound care encourages and speeds wound healing via cleaning and protection from reinjury or infection. Depending on each patient's needs, it can range from the simplest first aid to entire nursing specialties such as wound, ostomy, and continence nursing and burn center care.\nStages\nHemostasis (blood clotting): Within the first few minutes of injury, platelets in the blood begin to stick to the injured site. This activates the platelets, causing a few things to happen. They change into an amorphous shape, more suitable for clotting, and they release chemical signals to promote clotting. This results in the activation of fibrin, which forms a mesh and acts as \"glue\" to bind platelets to each other. This makes a clot that serves to plug the break in the blood vessel, slowing\/preventing further bleeding.[5][6]\nInflammation: During this phase, damaged and dead cells are cleared out, along with bacteria and other pathogens or debris. This happens through the process of phagocytosis, where white blood cells \"eat\" debris by engulfing it. Platelet-derived growth factors are released into the wound that cause the migration and division of cells during the proliferative phase.\nProliferation (growth of new tissue): In this phase, angiogenesis, collagen deposition, granulation tissue formation, epithelialization, and wound contraction occur.[7] In angiogenesis, vascular endothelial cells form new blood vessels.[8] In fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation, fibroblasts grow and form a new, provisional extracellular matrix (ECM) by excreting collagen and fibronectin.[7]  Concurrently, re-epithelialization of the epidermis occurs, in which epithelial cells proliferate and 'crawl' atop the wound bed, providing cover for the new tissue.[9] In wound contraction, myofibroblasts decrease the size of the wound by gripping the wound edges and contracting using a mechanism that resembles that in smooth muscle cells. When the cells' roles are close to complete, unneeded cells undergo apoptosis.[7]\nMaturation (remodeling): During maturation and remodeling, collagen is realigned along tension lines, and cells that are no longer needed are removed by programmed cell death, or apoptosis.\n\nTiming and reepithelialization\nTiming is important to wound healing. Critically, the timing of wound reepithelialization can decide the outcome of the healing.[11] If the epithelization of tissue over a denuded area is slow, a scar will form over many weeks, or months;[12][13] If the epithelization of a wounded area is fast, the healing will result in regeneration.[13]\nEarly vs cellular phase\n\nWound healing is classically divided into hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Although a useful construct, this model employs considerable overlapping among individual phases. A complementary model has recently been described[1] where the many elements of wound healing are more clearly delineated. The importance of this new model becomes more apparent through its utility in the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering (see Research and development section below). In this construct, the process of wound healing is divided into two major phases: the early phase and the cellular phase:[1]\nThe early phase, which begins immediately following skin injury, involves cascading molecular and cellular events leading to hemostasis and formation of an early, makeshift extracellular matrix that provides structural staging for cellular attachment and subsequent cellular proliferation.\nThe cellular phase involves several types of cells working together to mount an inflammatory response, synthesize granulation tissue, and restore the epithelial layer.[1] Subdivisions of the cellular phase are:  [1] Macrophages and inflammatory components (within 1\u20132 days), [2] Epithelial-mesenchymal interaction: re-epithelialization (phenotype change within hours, migration begins on day 1 or 2), [3] Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts: progressive alignment, collagen production, and matrix contraction (between day 4 and day 14), [4] Endothelial cells and angiogenesis (begins on day 4), [5] Dermal matrix: elements of fabrication (begins on day 4, lasting 2 weeks) and alteration\/remodeling (begins after week 2, lasting weeks to months\u2014depending on wound size).[1]\nInflammatory phase\nJust before the inflammatory phase is initiated, the clotting cascade occurs in order to achieve hemostasis, or stop blood loss by way of a fibrin clot. Thereafter, various soluble factors (including chemokines and cytokines) are released to attract cells that phagocytise debris, bacteria, and damaged tissue, in addition to releasing signaling molecules that initiate the proliferative phase of wound healing.\nClotting cascade\n\nWhen tissue is first wounded, blood comes in contact with collagen, triggering blood platelets to begin secreting inflammatory factors.[15]  Platelets also express sticky glycoproteins on their cell membranes that allow them to aggregate, forming a mass.[7]\nFibrin and fibronectin cross-link together and form a plug that traps proteins and particles and prevents further blood loss.[16]  This fibrin-fibronectin plug is also the main structural support for the wound until collagen is deposited.[7] Migratory cells use this plug as a matrix to crawl across, and platelets adhere to it and secrete factors.[7] The clot is eventually lysed and replaced with granulation tissue and then later with collagen.\nPlatelets, the cells present in the highest numbers shortly after a wound occurs, release mediators into the blood, including cytokines and growth factors.[15]  Growth factors stimulate cells to speed their rate of division. Platelets release other proinflammatory factors like serotonin, bradykinin, prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxane, and histamine,[3] which serve several purposes, including increasing cell proliferation and migration to the area and causing blood vessels to become dilated and porous. In many ways, extravasated platelets in trauma perform a similar function to tissue macrophages and mast cells exposed to microbial molecular signatures in infection: they become activated, and secrete molecular mediators \u2013 vasoactive amines, eicosanoids, and cytokines  \u2013 that initiate the inflammatory process.\nVasoconstriction and vasodilation\nImmediately after a blood vessel is breached, ruptured cell membranes release inflammatory factors like thromboxanes and prostaglandins that cause the vessel to spasm to prevent blood loss and to collect inflammatory cells and factors in the area.[3] This vasoconstriction lasts five to ten minutes and is followed by vasodilation, a widening of blood vessels, which peaks at about 20 minutes post-wounding.[3] Vasodilation is the end result of factors released by platelets and other cells. The main factor involved in causing vasodilation is histamine.[3][15] Histamine also causes blood vessels to become porous, allowing the tissue to become edematous because proteins from the bloodstream leak into the extravascular space, which increases its osmolar load and draws water into the area.[3] Increased porosity of blood vessels also facilitates the entry of inflammatory cells like leukocytes into the wound site from the bloodstream.[17][18]\nPolymorphonuclear neutrophils\nWithin an hour of wounding, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) arrive at the wound site and become the predominant cells in the wound for the first two days after the injury occurs, with especially high numbers on the second day.[19] They are attracted to the site by fibronectin, growth factors, and substances such as kinins. Neutrophils phagocytise debris and kill bacteria by releasing free radicals in what is called a 'respiratory burst.[20][21] They also cleanse the wound by secreting proteases that break down damaged tissue. Functional neutrophils at the wound site only have life-spans of around 2 days, so they usually undergo apoptosis once they have completed their tasks and are engulfed and degraded by macrophages.[22]\nOther leukocytes to enter the area include helper T cells, which secrete cytokines to cause more T cells to divide and to increase inflammation and enhance vasodilation and vessel permeability.[17][23] T cells also increase the activity of macrophages.[17]\nMacrophages\nOne of the macrophage's roles is to phagocytize other expended phagocytes,[24] bacteria and damaged tissue,[19] and they also debride damaged tissue by releasing proteases.[25]\nMacrophages function in regeneration[26][27]  and are essential for wound healing.[19] They are stimulated by the low oxygen content of their surroundings to produce factors that induce and speed angiogenesis[20] and they also stimulate cells that reepithelialize the wound, create granulation tissue, and lay down a new extracellular matrix.[28] By secreting these factors, macrophages contribute to pushing the wound healing process into the next phase. They replace PMNs as the predominant cells in the wound by two days after injury.[24]\nThe spleen contains half the body's monocytes in reserve ready to be deployed to injured tissue.[29][30] Attracted to the wound site by growth factors released by platelets and other cells, monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessel walls.[31] Numbers of monocytes in the wound peak one to one and a half days after the injury occurs.[23] Once they are in the wound site, monocytes mature into macrophages. Macrophages also secrete a number of factors such as growth factors and other cytokines, especially during the third and fourth post-wounding days. These factors attract cells involved in the proliferation stage of healing to the area.[15]\nIn wound healing that result in incomplete repair, scar contraction occurs, bringing varying gradations of structural imperfections, deformities and problems with flexibility.[32] Macrophages may restrain the contraction phase.[27] Scientists have reported that removing the macrophages from a salamander resulted in failure of a typical regeneration response (limb regeneration), instead bringing on a repair (scarring) response.[33][34]\nDecline of inflammatory phase\nAs inflammation dies down, fewer inflammatory factors are secreted, existing ones are broken down, and numbers of neutrophils and macrophages are reduced at the wound site.[19]  These changes indicate that the inflammatory phase is ending and the proliferative phase is underway.[19] In vitro evidence, obtained using the dermal equivalent model, suggests that the presence of macrophages actually delays wound contraction and thus the disappearance of macrophages from the wound may be essential for subsequent phases to occur.[27]\nBecause inflammation plays roles in fighting infection, clearing debris and inducing the proliferation phase, it is a necessary part of healing. However, inflammation can lead to tissue damage if it lasts too long.[7] Thus the reduction of inflammation is frequently a goal in therapeutic settings. Inflammation lasts as long as there is debris in the wound. Thus, if the individual's immune system is compromised and is unable to clear the debris from the wound and\/or if excessive detritus, devitalized tissue, or microbial biofilm is present in the wound, these factors may cause a prolonged inflammatory phase and prevent the wound from properly commencing the proliferation phase of healing. This can lead to a chronic wound.\nProliferative phase\nAbout two or three days after the wound occurs, fibroblasts begin to enter the wound site, marking the onset of the proliferative phase even before the inflammatory phase has ended.[35] As in the other phases of wound healing, steps in the proliferative phase do not occur in a series but rather partially overlap in time.\nAngiogenesis\n\nAlso called neovascularization, the process of angiogenesis occurs concurrently with fibroblast proliferation when endothelial cells migrate to the area of the wound.[36] Because the activity of fibroblasts and epithelial cells requires oxygen and nutrients, angiogenesis is imperative for other stages in wound healing, like epidermal and fibroblast migration. The tissue in which angiogenesis has occurred typically looks red (is erythematous) due to the presence of capillaries.[36]\nAngiogenesis occurs in overlapping phases in response to inflammation:\nLatent period: During the haemostatic and inflammatory phase of the wound healing process, vasodilation and permeabilisation allow leukocyte extravasation and phagocytic debridement and decontamination of the wound area. Tissue swelling aids later angiogenesis by expanding and loosening the existing collagenous extracellular matrix.\nEndothelial activation: As the wound macrophages switches from inflammatory to healing mode, it begins to secrete endothelial chemotactic and growth factors to attract adjacent endothelial cells. Activated endothelial cells respond by retracting and reducing cell junctions, loosening themselves from their embedded endothelium. Characteristically the activated endothelial cells show enlarged nucleoli.\nDegradation of endothelial basement membrane: The wound macrophages, mast cells and the endothelial cells themselves secrete proteases to break down existing vascular basal lamina.\nVascular sprouting: With the breakdown of endothelial basement membrane, detached endothelial cells from pre-existing capillaries and post-capillary venules can divide and migrate chemotactically towards the wound, laying down new vessels in the process. Vascular sprouting can be aided by ambient hypoxia and acidosis in the wound environment, as hypoxia stimulates the endothelial transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) to transactivate angiogenic genes such as VEGF and GLUT1. Sprouted vessels can self-organise into luminal morphologies, and fusion of blind channels give rise to new capillary networks.\nVascular maturation: the endothelium of vessels mature by laying down new endothelial extracellular matrix, followed by basal lamina formation. Lastly the vessel establishes a pericyte layer.\nStem cells of endothelial cells, originating from parts of uninjured blood vessels, develop pseudopodia and push through the ECM into the wound site to establish new blood vessels.[20]\nEndothelial cells are attracted to the wound area by fibronectin found on the fibrin scab and chemotactically by angiogenic factors released by other cells,[37] e.g. from macrophages and platelets when in a low-oxygen environment. Endothelial growth and proliferation is also directly stimulated by hypoxia, and presence of lactic acid in the wound.[35] For example, hypoxia stimulates the endothelial transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) to transactivate a set of proliferative genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1).\nTo migrate, endothelial cells need collagenases and plasminogen activator to degrade the clot and part of the ECM.[3][19] Zinc-dependent metalloproteinases digest basement membrane and ECM to allow cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis.[38]\nWhen macrophages and other growth factor-producing cells are no longer in a hypoxic, lactic acid-filled environment, they stop producing angiogenic factors.[20] Thus, when tissue is adequately perfused, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells is reduced. Eventually blood vessels that are no longer needed die by apoptosis.[37]\nFibroplasia and granulation tissue formation\nSimultaneously with angiogenesis, fibroblasts begin accumulating in the wound site. Fibroblasts begin entering the wound site two to five days after wounding as the inflammatory phase is ending, and their numbers peak at one to two weeks post-wounding.[19] By the end of the first week, fibroblasts are the main cells in the wound.[3] Fibroplasia ends two to four weeks after wounding.\nAs a model the mechanism of fibroplasia may be conceptualised as an analogous process to angiogenesis (see above) - only the cell type involved is fibroblasts rather than endothelial cells. Initially there is a latent phase where the wound undergoes plasma exudation, inflammatory decontamination and debridement. Oedema increases the wound histologic accessibility for later fibroplastic migration. Second, as inflammation nears completion, macrophage and mast cells release fibroblast growth and chemotactic factors to activate fibroblasts from adjacent tissue. Fibroblasts at this stage loosen themselves from surrounding cells and ECM. Phagocytes further release proteases that break down the ECM of neighbouring tissue, freeing the activated fibroblasts to proliferate and migrate towards the wound. The difference between vascular sprouting and fibroblast proliferation is that the former is enhanced by hypoxia, whilst the latter is inhibited by hypoxia. The deposited fibroblastic connective tissue matures by secreting ECM into the extracellular space, forming granulation tissue (see below). Lastly collagen is deposited into the ECM.\nIn the first two or three days after injury, fibroblasts mainly migrate and proliferate, while later, they are the main cells that lay down the collagen matrix in the wound site.[3] Origins of these fibroblasts are thought to be from the adjacent uninjured cutaneous tissue (although new evidence suggests that some are derived from blood-borne, circulating adult stem cells\/precursors).[39] Initially fibroblasts utilize the fibrin cross-linking fibers (well-formed by the end of the inflammatory phase) to migrate across the wound, subsequently adhering to fibronectin.[37]   Fibroblasts then deposit ground substance into the wound bed, and later collagen, which they can adhere to for migration.[15]\nGranulation tissue functions as rudimentary tissue, and begins to appear in the wound already during the inflammatory phase, two to five days post wounding, and continues growing until the wound bed is covered.  Granulation tissue consists of new blood vessels, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and the components of a new, provisional extracellular matrix (ECM). The provisional ECM is different in composition from the ECM in normal tissue and its components originate from fibroblasts.[28] Such components include fibronectin, collagen, glycosaminoglycans, elastin, glycoproteins and proteoglycans.[37] Its main components are fibronectin and hyaluronan, which create a very hydrated matrix and facilitate cell migration.[31] Later this provisional matrix is replaced with an ECM that more closely resembles that found in non-injured tissue.\nGrowth factors (PDGF, TGF-\u03b2) and fibronectin encourage proliferation, migration to the wound bed, and production of ECM molecules by fibroblasts. Fibroblasts also secrete growth factors that attract epithelial cells to the wound site.  Hypoxia also contributes to fibroblast proliferation and excretion of growth factors, though too little oxygen will inhibit their growth and deposition of ECM components, and can lead to excessive, fibrotic scarring.\nCollagen deposition\nOne of fibroblasts' most important duties is the production of collagen.[36]\nCollagen deposition is important because it increases the strength of the wound; before it is laid down, the only thing holding the wound closed is the fibrin-fibronectin clot, which does not provide much resistance to traumatic injury.[20] Also, cells involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue construction attach to, grow and differentiate on the collagen matrix laid down by fibroblasts.[40]\nType III collagen and fibronectin generally begin to be produced in appreciable amounts at somewhere between approximately 10 hours[41] and 3 days,[37] depending mainly on wound size. Their deposition peaks at one to three weeks.[28] They are the predominating tensile substances until the later phase of maturation, in which they are replaced by the stronger type I collagen.\nEven as fibroblasts are producing new collagen, collagenases and other factors degrade it. Shortly after wounding, synthesis exceeds degradation so collagen levels in the wound rise, but later production and degradation become equal so there is no net collagen gain.[20] This homeostasis signals the onset of the later maturation phase. Granulation gradually ceases and fibroblasts decrease in number in the wound once their work is done.[42] At the end of the granulation phase, fibroblasts begin to commit apoptosis, converting granulation tissue from an environment rich in cells to one that consists mainly of collagen.[3]\nEpithelialization\nThe formation of granulation tissue into an open wound allows the reepithelialization phase to take place, as epithelial cells migrate across the new tissue to form a barrier between the wound and the environment.[37] Basal keratinocytes from the wound edges and dermal appendages such as hair follicles, sweat glands and sebacious (oil) glands are the main cells responsible for the epithelialization phase of wound healing.[42] They advance in a sheet across the wound site and proliferate at its edges, ceasing movement when they meet in the middle. In healing that results in a scar, sweat glands, hair follicles[43][44] and nerves do not form. With the lack of hair follicles, nerves and sweat glands, the wound, and the resulting healing scar, provide a challenge to the body with regards to temperature control.[44]\nKeratinocytes migrate without first proliferating.[45] Migration can begin as early as a few hours after wounding. However, epithelial cells require viable tissue to migrate across, so if the wound is deep it must first be filled with granulation tissue.[46] Thus the time of onset of migration is variable and may occur about one day after wounding.[47] Cells on the wound margins proliferate on the second and third day post-wounding in order to provide more cells for migration.[28]\nIf the basement membrane is not breached, epithelial cells are replaced within three days by division and upward migration of cells in the stratum basale in the same fashion that occurs in uninjured skin.[37] However, if the basement membrane is ruined at the wound site, reepithelization must occur from the wound margins and from skin appendages such as hair follicles and sweat and oil glands that enter the dermis that are lined with viable keratinocytes.[28] If the wound is very deep, skin appendages may also be ruined and migration can only occur from wound edges.[46]\nMigration of keratinocytes over the wound site is stimulated by lack of contact inhibition and by chemicals such as nitric oxide.[48] Before they begin to migrate, cells must dissolve their desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, which normally anchor the cells by intermediate filaments in their cytoskeleton to other cells and to the ECM.[23] Transmembrane receptor proteins called integrins, which are made of glycoproteins and normally anchor the cell to the basement membrane by its cytoskeleton, are released from the cell's intermediate filaments and relocate to actin filaments to serve as attachments to the ECM for pseudopodia during migration.[23] Thus keratinocytes detach from the basement membrane and are able to enter the wound bed.[35]\nBefore they begin migrating, keratinocytes change shape, becoming longer and flatter and extending cellular processes like lamellipodia and wide processes that look like ruffles.[31] Actin filaments and pseudopodia form.[35] During migration, integrins on the pseudopod attach to the ECM, and the actin filaments in the projection pull the cell along.[23] The interaction with molecules in the ECM through integrins further promotes the formation of actin filaments, lamellipodia, and filopodia.[23]\nEpithelial cells climb over one another in order to migrate.[42] This growing sheet of epithelial cells is often called the epithelial tongue.[45] The first cells to attach to the basement membrane form the stratum basale. These basal cells continue to migrate across the wound bed, and epithelial cells above them slide along as well.[45] The more quickly this migration occurs, the less of a scar there will be.[49]\nFibrin, collagen, and fibronectin in the ECM may further signal cells to divide and migrate.  Like fibroblasts, migrating keratinocytes use the fibronectin cross-linked with fibrin that was deposited in inflammation as an attachment site to crawl across.[25][31][42]\n\nAs keratinocytes migrate, they move over granulation tissue but stay underneath the scab, thereby separating the scab from the underlying tissue.[42][47] Scabs are formed on locations that are exposed to harmful UVR and the main biological function of\nhuman wound scabs is to inhibit the exposure to UVR, thus protecting otherwise exposed cells in a wound from UVR-induced DNA damage.[50] Epithelial cells have the ability to phagocytize debris such as dead tissue and bacterial matter that would otherwise obstruct their path.  Because they must dissolve any scab that forms, keratinocyte migration is best enhanced by a moist environment, since a dry one leads to formation of a bigger, tougher scab.[25][37][42][51] To make their way along the tissue, keratinocytes must dissolve the clot, debris, and parts of the ECM in order to get through.[47][52] They secrete plasminogen activator, which activates plasminogen, turning it into plasmin to dissolve the scab.  Cells can only migrate over living tissue,[42] so they must excrete collagenases and proteases like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to dissolve damaged parts of the ECM in their way, particularly at the front of the migrating sheet.[47] Keratinocytes also dissolve the basement membrane, using instead the new ECM laid down by fibroblasts to crawl across.[23]\nAs keratinocytes continue migrating, new epithelial cells must be formed at the wound edges to replace them and to provide more cells for the advancing sheet.[25] Proliferation behind migrating keratinocytes normally begins a few days after wounding[46] and occurs at a rate that is 17 times higher in this stage of epithelialization than in normal tissues.[25] Until the entire wound area is resurfaced, the only epithelial cells to proliferate are at the wound edges.[45]\nGrowth factors, stimulated by integrins and MMPs, cause cells to proliferate at the wound edges.  Keratinocytes themselves also produce and secrete factors, including growth factors and basement membrane proteins, which aid both in epithelialization and in other phases of healing.[53] Growth factors are also important for the innate immune defense of skin wounds by stimulation of the production of antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil chemotactic cytokines in keratinocytes.   \nKeratinocytes continue migrating across the wound bed until cells from either side meet in the middle, at which point contact inhibition causes them to stop migrating.[31]  When they have finished migrating, the keratinocytes secrete the proteins that form the new basement membrane.[31]  Cells reverse the morphological changes they underwent in order to begin migrating; they reestablish desmosomes and hemidesmosomes and become anchored once again to the basement membrane.[23] Basal cells begin to divide and differentiate in the same manner as they do in normal skin to reestablish the strata found in reepithelialized skin.[31]\nContraction\nContraction is a key phase of wound healing with repair. If contraction continues for too long, it can lead to disfigurement and loss of function.[32] Thus there is a great interest in understanding the biology of wound contraction, which can be modelled in vitro using the collagen gel contraction assay or the dermal equivalent model.[27][54]\nContraction commences approximately a week after wounding, when fibroblasts have differentiated into myofibroblasts.[55]  In full thickness wounds, contraction peaks at 5 to 15 days post wounding.[37] Contraction can last for several weeks[46] and continues even after the wound is completely reepithelialized.[3] A large wound can become 40 to 80% smaller after contraction.[31][42]  Wounds can contract at a speed of up to 0.75mm per day, depending on how loose the tissue in the wounded area is.[37]  Contraction usually does not occur symmetrically; rather most wounds have an 'axis of contraction' which allows for greater organization and alignment of cells with collagen.[55]\nAt first, contraction occurs without myofibroblast involvement.[56]  Later, fibroblasts, stimulated by growth factors, differentiate into myofibroblasts.  Myofibroblasts, which are similar to smooth muscle cells, are responsible for contraction.[56]  Myofibroblasts contain the same kind of actin as that found in smooth muscle cells.[32]\nMyofibroblasts are attracted by fibronectin and growth factors and they move along fibronectin linked to fibrin in the provisional ECM in order to reach the wound edges.[25]  They form connections to the ECM at the wound edges, and they attach to each other and to the wound edges by desmosomes.  Also, at an adhesion called the fibronexus, actin in the myofibroblast is linked across the cell membrane to molecules in the extracellular matrix like fibronectin and collagen.[56]  Myofibroblasts have many such adhesions, which allow them to pull the ECM when they contract, reducing the wound size.[32]  In this part of contraction, closure occurs more quickly than in the first, myofibroblast-independent part.[56]\nAs the actin in myofibroblasts contracts, the wound edges are pulled together.  Fibroblasts lay down collagen to reinforce the wound as myofibroblasts contract.[3] The contraction stage in proliferation ends as myofibroblasts stop contracting and commit apoptosis.[32]  The breakdown of the provisional matrix leads to a decrease in hyaluronic acid and an increase in chondroitin sulfate, which gradually triggers fibroblasts to stop migrating and proliferating.[19]  These events signal the onset of the maturation stage of wound healing.\nMaturation and remodeling\nWhen the levels of collagen production and degradation equalize, the maturation phase of tissue repair is said to have begun.[20] During maturation, type III collagen, which is prevalent during proliferation, is replaced by type I collagen.[17] Originally disorganized collagen fibers are rearranged, cross-linked, and aligned along tension lines.[31] The onset of the maturation phase may vary extensively, depending on the size of the wound and whether it was initially closed or left open,[28] ranging from approximately 3 days[41] to 3 weeks.[57] The maturation phase can last for a year or longer, similarly depending on wound type.[28]\nAs the phase progresses, the tensile strength of the wound increases.[28] Collagen will reach approximately 20% of its tensile strength after 3 weeks, increasing to 80% by 12th week. The maximum scar strength is 80% of that of unwounded skin.[58] Since activity at the wound site is reduced, the scar loses its red appearance as blood vessels that are no longer needed are removed by apoptosis.[20]\nThe phases of wound healing normally progress in a predictable, timely manner; if they do not, healing may progress inappropriately to either a chronic wound[7] such as a venous ulcer or pathological scarring such as a keloid scar.[59][60]\nFactors affecting wound healing\nMany factors controlling the efficacy, speed, and manner of wound healing fall under two types: local and systemic factors.[2]\nLocal factors\nMoisture; keeping a wound moist rather than dry makes wound healing more rapid and with less pain and less scarring[61]\nMechanical factors\nEdema\nIonizing radiation\nFaculty technique of wound closure\nIschemia and necrosis\nForeign bodies. Sharp, small foreign bodies can penetrate the skin leaving little surface wound but causing internal injury and internal bleeding. For a glass foreign body, \"frequently, an innocent skin wound disguises the extensive nature of the injuries beneath\".[62] First-degree nerve injury requires a few hours to a few weeks to recover.[63] If a foreign body passes by a nerve and causes first-degree nerve injury during entry, then the sensation of the foreign body or pain due to internal wounding may be delayed by a few hours to a few weeks after entry. A sudden increase in pain during the first few weeks of wound healing could be a sign of a recovered nerve reporting internal injuries rather than a newly developed infection.\nLow oxygen tension\nPerfusion\nSystemic factors\nInflammation\nDiabetes \u2013 Individuals with diabetes demonstrate reduced capability in the healing of acute wounds. Additionally, diabetic individuals are susceptible to developing chronic diabetic foot ulcers, a serious complication of diabetes which affects 15% of people with diabetes and accounts for 84% of all diabetes-related lower leg amputations.[64] The impaired healing abilities of diabetics with diabetic foot ulcers and\/or acute wounds involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms.[65] This impaired healing involves hypoxia, fibroblast and epidermal cell dysfunction, impaired angiogenesis and neovascularization, high levels of metalloproteases, damage from reactive oxygen species and AGEs (advanced glycation end-products), decreased host immune resistance, and neuropathy.[65]\nNutrients \u2013 Malnutrition or nutritional deficiencies have a recognizable impact on wound healing post trauma or surgical intervention.[66] Nutrients including proteins, carbohydrates, arginine, glutamine, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, magnesium, copper, zinc and iron all play significant roles in wound healing.[65] Fats and carbohydrates provide the majority of energy required for wound healing.  Glucose is the most prominent source of fuel and it is used to create cellular ATP, providing energy for angiogenesis and the deposition of new tissues.[65] As the nutritional needs of each patient and their associated wound are complex, it is suggested that tailored nutritional support would benefit both acute and chronic wound healing.[65]\nMetabolic diseases\nImmunosuppression\nConnective tissue disorders\nSmoking \u2013 Smoking causes a delay in the speed of wound repair notably in the proliferative and inflammatory phases. It also increases the likelihood of certain complications such as wound rupture, wound and flap necrosis, decrease in wound tensile strength and infection.[65]\nAge \u2013 Increased age (over 60 years) is a risk factor for impaired wound healing.[65] It is recognized that, in older adults of otherwise overall good health, the effects of aging causes a temporal delay in healing, but no major impairment with regard to the quality of healing.[67] Delayed wound healing in patients of increasing age is associated with altered inflammatory response; for example delayed T-cell infiltration of the wound with alterations in the production of chemokines, and reduced macrophage phagocytic capacity.[68]\nAlcohol \u2013 Alcohol consumption impairs wound healing and also increases the chances of infection. Alcohol affects the proliferative phase of healing. A single unit of alcohol causes a negative effect on re-epithelialization, wound closure, collagen production and angiogenesis.[65]\nResearch and development\nUp until about 2000, the classic paradigm of wound healing, involving stem cells restricted to organ-specific lineages, had never been seriously challenged. Since then, the notion of adult stem cells having cellular plasticity or the ability to differentiate into non-lineage cells has emerged as an alternative explanation.[1] To be more specific, hematopoietic progenitor cells (that give rise to mature cells in the blood) may have the ability de-differentiate  back into hematopoietic stem cells and\/or transdifferentiate into non-lineage cells, such as fibroblasts.[39]\nStem cells and cellular plasticity\nMultipotent adult stem cells have the capacity to be self-renewing and give rise to different cell types. Stem cells give rise to progenitor cells, which are cells that are not self-renewing, but can generate several types of cells. The extent of stem cell involvement in cutaneous (skin) wound healing is complex and not fully understood.\nIt is thought that the epidermis and dermis are reconstituted by mitotically active stem cells that reside at the apex of rete ridges (basal stem cells or BSC), the bulge of hair follicles (hair follicular stem cell or HFSC), and the papillary dermis (dermal stem cells).[1] Moreover, bone marrow may also contain stem cells that play a major role in cutaneous wound healing.[39]\nIn rare circumstances, such as extensive cutaneous injury, self-renewal subpopulations in the bone marrow are induced to participate in the healing process, whereby they give rise to collagen-secreting cells that seem to play a role during wound repair.[1] These two self-renewal subpopulations are (1) bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and (2) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Bone marrow also harbors a progenitor subpopulation (endothelial progenitor cells or EPC) that, in the same type of setting, are mobilized to aid in the reconstruction of blood vessels.[39] Moreover, it thought that, extensive injury to skin also promotes the early trafficking of a unique subclass of leukocytes (circulating fibrocytes) to the injured region, where they perform various  functions related to wound healing.[1]\nWound repair versus regeneration\nAn injury is an interruption of morphology and\/or functionality of a given tissue. After injury, structural tissue heals with incomplete or complete regeneration.[69][70] Whereas, tissue without an interruption to the morphology almost always completely regenerates. An example of complete regeneration without an interruption of the morphology is non-injured tissue, such as skin.[71] Non-injured skin has a continued replacement and regeneration of cells which always results in complete regeneration.[71]\nThere is a subtle distinction between 'repair' and 'regeneration'.[1][69][70] Repair means incomplete regeneration.[69] Repair or incomplete regeneration, refers to the physiologic adaptation of an organ after injury in an effort to re-establish continuity without regards to exact replacement of lost\/damaged tissue.[69]\nTrue tissue regeneration or complete regeneration,[70] refers to the replacement of lost\/damaged tissue with an \u2018exact\u2019 copy, such that both morphology and functionality are completely restored.[70]  Though after injury mammals can completely regenerate spontaneously, they usually do not completely regenerate. An example of a tissue regenerating completely after an interruption of morphology is the endometrium; the endometrium after the process of breakdown via the menstruation cycle heals with complete regeneration.[71]\nIn some instances, after a tissue breakdown, such as in skin, a regeneration closer to complete regeneration may be induced by the use of biodegradable (collagen-glycoaminoglycan) scaffolds. These scaffolds are structurally analogous to extracellular matrix (ECM) found in normal\/un-injured dermis.[72] Fundamental conditions required for tissue regeneration often oppose conditions that favor efficient wound repair, including inhibition of (1) platelet activation, (2) inflammatory response, and (3) wound contraction.[1] In addition to providing support for fibroblast and endothelial cell attachment, biodegradable scaffolds inhibit wound contraction, thereby allowing the healing process to proceed towards a more-regenerative\/less-scarring pathway. Pharmaceutical agents have been investigated which may be able to turn off myofibroblast differentiation.[73]\nA new way of thinking derived from the notion that heparan sulfates are key player in tissue homeostasis:  the process that makes the tissue replace dead cells by identical cells. In wound areas, tissue homeostasis is lost as the heparan sulfates are degraded preventing the replacement of dead cells by identical cells. Heparan sulfate analogues cannot be degraded by all know heparanases and glycanases and bind to the free heparin sulfate binding spots on the ECM, therefore preserving the normal tissue homeostasis and preventing scarring.[74][75][76]\nRepair or regeneration with regards to hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a). In normal circumstances after injury HIF-1a is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Scientists found that the simple up-regulation of HIF-1a via PHD inhibitors regenerates lost or damaged tissue in mammals that have a repair response; and the continued down-regulation of Hif-1a results in healing with a scarring response in mammals with a previous regenerative response to the loss of tissue. The act of regulating HIF-1a can either turn off, or turn on the key process of mammalian regeneration.[77][78]\nScarless wound healing\nScarless wound healing is a concept based on the healing or repair of the skin (or other tissue\/organs) after injury with the aim of healing with subjectively and relatively less scar tissue than normally expected. Scarless healing is sometimes mixed up with the concept of scar free healing, which is wound healing which results in absolutely no scar (free of scarring). However they are different concepts.\nA reverse to scarless wound healing is scarification (wound healing to scar more). Historically, certain cultures consider scarification attractive;[79] however, this is generally not the case in the modern western society, in which many patients are turning to plastic surgery clinics with unrealistic expectations. Depending on scar type, treatment may be invasive (intralesional steroid injections, surgery) and\/or conservative (compression therapy, topical silicone gel, brachytherapy, photodynamic therapy).[80] Clinical judgment is necessary to successfully balance the potential benefits of the various treatments available against the likelihood of a poor response and possible complications resulting from these treatments. Many of these treatments may only have a placebo effect, and the evidence base for the use of many current treatments is poor.[81]\nSince the 1960s, comprehension of the basic biologic processes involved in wound repair and tissue regeneration have expanded due to advances in cellular and molecular biology.[82] Currently, the principal goals in wound management are to achieve rapid wound closure with a functional tissue that has minimal aesthetic scarring.[83] However, the ultimate goal of wound healing biology is to induce a more perfect reconstruction of the wound area. Scarless wound healing only occurs in mammalian foetal tissues[84] and complete regeneration is limited to lower vertebrates, such as salamanders, and invertebrates.[85] In adult humans, injured tissue are repaired by collagen deposition, collagen remodelling and eventual scar formation, where fetal wound healing is believed to be more of a regenerative process with minimal or no scar formation.[84] Therefore, foetal wound healing can be used to provide an accessible mammalian model of an optimal healing response in adult human tissues. Clues as to how this might be achieved come from studies of wound healing in embryos, where repair is fast and efficient and results in essentially perfect regeneration of any lost tissue.\nThe etymology of the term scarless wound healing has a long history.[86][87][88] In print the antiquated concept of scarless healing was brought up the early 20th century and appeared in a paper published in the London Lancet. This process involved cutting in a surgical slant, instead of a right angle\u2026; it was described in various Newspapers.[86][87][88]\nCancer\nAfter inflammation, restoration of normal tissue integrity and function is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted cytokines. Disruption of normal feedback mechanisms in cancer threatens tissue integrity and enables a malignant tumor to escape the immune system.[89][90]\nSimulating wound healing from a growth perspective\nConsiderable effort has been devoted to understanding the physical relationships governing wound healing and subsequent scarring, with mathematical models and simulations developed to elucidate these relationships.[91]  The growth of tissue around the wound site is a result of the migration of cells and collagen deposition by these cells.  The alignment of collagen describes the degree of scarring; basket-weave orientation of collagen is characteristic of normal skin, whereas aligned collagen fibers lead to significant scarring.[92]  It has been shown that the growth of tissue and extent of scar formation can be controlled by modulating the stress at a wound site.[93]\nThe growth of tissue can be simulated using the aforementioned relationships from a biochemical and biomechanical point of view.  The biologically active chemicals that play an important role in wound healing are modeled with Fickian diffusion to generate concentration profiles.  The balance equation for open systems when modeling wound healing incorporates mass growth due to cell migration and proliferation.  Here the following equation is used:\nDt\u03c10 = Div (R) + R0,\nwhere \u03c1 represents mass density, R represents a mass flux (from cell migration), and R0 represents a mass source (from cell proliferation, division, or enlargement).[94] Relationships like these can be incorporated into an agent-based models, where the sensitivity to single parameters such as initial collagen alignment, cytokine properties, and cell proliferation rates can be tested.[95]\nWound closure intentions\nSuccessful wound healing is dependent on various cell types, molecular mediators and structural elements.[96]\nPrimary intention\nPrimary intention is the healing of a clean wound without tissue loss.[96] In this process, wound edges are brought together, so that they are adjacent to each other (re-approximated). Wound closure is performed with sutures (stitches), staples, or adhesive tape or glue.\nPrimary intention can only be implemented when the wound is precise and there is minimal disruption to the local tissue and the epithelial basement membrane, e.g. surgical incisions.[97]\nThis process is faster than healing by secondary intention.[96] There is also less scarring associated with primary intention, as there are no large tissue losses to be filled with granulation tissue.[96] (Primary intention does require some granulation tissue to form.)\nExamples of primary intention include: well-repaired lacerations, well reduced bone fractures, healing after flap surgery.\nSecondary intention\nSecondary intention is implemented when primary intention is not possible.\nThis is due to wounds being created by major trauma in which there has been a significant loss in tissue or tissue damage.[97]\nThe wound is allowed to granulate.\nSurgeon may pack the wound with a gauze or use a drainage system.\nGranulation results in a broader scar.\nHealing process can be slow due to presence of drainage from infection.\nWound care must be performed daily to encourage wound debris removal to allow for granulation tissue formation.\nUsing antibiotics or antiseptics for the surgical wound healing by secondary intention is controversial.[98]\nExamples: gingivectomy, gingivoplasty, tooth extraction sockets, poorly reduced fractures, burns, severe lacerations, pressure ulcers.\nTertiary intention\n(Delayed primary closure or secondary suture):\nThe wound is initially cleaned, debrided and observed, typically 4 or 5 days before closure.\nThe wound is purposely left open.\nExamples: healing of wounds by use of tissue grafts.\nIf the wound edges are not reapproximated immediately, delayed primary wound healing transpires. This type of healing may be desired in the case of contaminated wounds. By the fourth day, phagocytosis of contaminated tissues is well underway, and the processes of epithelization, collagen deposition, and maturation are occurring. Foreign materials are walled off by macrophages that may metamorphose into epithelioid cells, which are encircled by mononuclear leukocytes, forming granulomas. Usually the wound is closed surgically at this juncture, and if the \"cleansing\" of the wound is incomplete, chronic inflammation can ensue, resulting in prominent scarring.\nOverview of involved growth factors\nFollowing are the main growth factors involved in wound healing:\n\nComplications of wound healing\nThe major complications are many:\nDeficient scar formation: Results in wound dehiscence or rupture of the wound due to inadequate formation of granulation tissue.\nExcessive scar formation: Hypertrophic scar, keloid, desmoid.\nExuberant granulation (proud flesh).\nDeficient contraction (in skin grafts) or excessive contraction (in burns).\nOthers: Dystrophic calcification, pigmentary changes, painful scars, incisional hernia\nOther complications can include Infection and Marjolin's ulcer.\nBiologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds\nAdvancements in the clinical understanding of wounds and their pathophysiology have commanded significant biomedical innovations in the treatment of acute, chronic, and other types of wounds. Many biologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds have been developed to facilitate wound healing through various mechanisms.[100] This includes a number of products under the trade names such as Epicel, Laserskin, Transcyte, Dermagraft, AlloDerm\/Strattice, Biobrane, Integra, Apligraf, OrCel, GraftJacket and PermaDerm.[101]\nSee also\n\nCollective cell migration\nDressing (medical)\nHistory of wound care\nRegeneration in humans\nWound bed preparation\nWound licking\nScar free healing\n\nNotes and references\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"53e0fe2d-7c64-4ab6-803c-4eeafbbebd25"}

Boas first articulated the idea in 1887: \"civilization is not something absolute, but ... is relative, and ... our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes\".[1] However, Boas did not coin the term. \nThe first use of the term recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary was by philosopher and social theorist Alain Locke in 1924 to describe Robert Lowie's \"extreme cultural relativism\", found in the latter's 1917 book .[2]  The term became common among anthropologists after Boas' death in 1942, to express their synthesis of a number of ideas Boas had developed. Boas believed that the sweep of cultures, to be found in connection with any sub species, is so vast and pervasive that there cannot be a relationship between culture and race.[3] Cultural relativism involves specific epistemological and methodological claims.  Whether or not these claims necessitate a specific ethical stance is a matter of debate. This principle should not be confused with moral relativism.\nEpistemological origins\n\nHerodotus (Histories 3.38) observes on the relativity of mores (\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9):\nIf anyone, no matter who, were given the opportunity of choosing from amongst all the nations in the world the set of beliefs which he thought best, he would inevitably\u2014after careful considerations of their relative merits\u2014choose that of his own country. Everyone without exception believes his own native customs, and the religion he was brought up in, to be the best; and that being so, it is unlikely that anyone but a madman would mock at such things. There is abundant evidence that this is the universal feeling about the ancient customs of one's country.\u2014tr. Aubrey de Selincourt\n\nHe mentions an anecdote of Darius the Great who illustrated the principle by inquiring about the funeral customs of the Greeks and the Callatiae, peoples from the extreme western and eastern fringes of his empire, respectively. They practiced cremation and funerary cannibalism, respectively, and were each dismayed and abhorred at the proposition of the other tribe's practices.\nThe epistemological claims that led to the development of cultural relativism have their origins in the German Enlightenment.  The philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that human beings are not capable of direct, unmediated knowledge of the world.  All of our experiences of the world are mediated through the human mind, which universally structures perceptions according to a priori concepts of time and space.\nAlthough Kant considered these mediating structures universal, his student Johann Gottfried Herder argued that human creativity, evidenced by the great variety in national cultures, revealed that human experience was mediated not only by universal structures, but by particular cultural structures as well.  The philosopher and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant and Herder's ideas.\nAlthough Herder focused on the positive value of cultural variety, the sociologist William Graham Sumner called attention to the fact that one's culture can limit one's perceptions.  He called this principle ethnocentrism, the viewpoint that \"one's own group is the center of everything\", against which all other groups are judged.\nAs a methodological and heuristic device\nAccording to George Marcus, Michael Fischer, and Sam Bohart,\n20th century social and cultural anthropology has promised its still largely Western readership enlightenment on two fronts.  The one has been the salvaging of distinct cultural forms of life from a process of apparent global Westernization. With both its romantic appeal and its scientific intentions, anthropology has stood for the refusal to accept this conventional perception of homogenization toward a dominant Western model.[4]\n\nCultural relativism was in part a response to Western ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism may take obvious forms, in which one consciously believes that one's people's arts are the most beautiful, values the most virtuous, and beliefs the most truthful.  Franz Boas, originally trained in physics and geography, and heavily influenced by the thought of Kant, Herder, and von Humboldt, argued that one's culture may mediate and thus limit one's perceptions in less obvious ways.  He understood \"culture\" to include not only certain tastes in food, art, and music, or beliefs about religion.  He assumed a much broader notion of culture, defined as\nthe totality of the mental and physical reactions and activities that characterize the behavior of the individuals composing a social group collectively and individually in relation to their natural environment, to other groups, to members of the group itself, and of each individual to himself.[5]\n\nThis view of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one's own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture.  The principle of cultural relativism thus forced anthropologists to develop innovative methods and heuristic strategies.\nAs a methodological tool\nBetween World War I and World War II, \"cultural relativism\" was the central tool for American anthropologists in this rejection of Western claims to universality, and salvage of non-Western cultures.  It functioned to transform Boas' epistemology into methodological lessons.\nThis is most obvious in the case of language.  Although language is commonly thought of as a means of communication, Boas called attention especially to the idea that it is also a means of categorizing experiences, hypothesizing that the existence of different languages suggests that people categorize, and thus experience, language differently (this view was more fully developed in the hypothesis of Linguistic relativity).\nThus, although all people perceive visible radiation the same way, in terms of a continuum of color, people who speak different languages slice up this continuum into discrete colors in different ways.  Some languages have no word that corresponds to the English word \"green\". When people who speak such languages are shown a green chip, some identify it using their word for blue, others identify it using their word for yellow. Thus, Boas's student Melville Herskovits summed up the principle of cultural relativism thus: \"Judgements are based on experience, and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation.\"\nBoas pointed out that scientists grow up and work in a particular culture, and are thus necessarily ethnocentric. He provided an example of this in his 1889 article, \"On Alternating Sounds\"[6]  A number of linguists at Boas' time had observed that speakers of some Native American languages pronounced the same word with different sounds indiscriminately. They thought that this meant that the languages were unorganized and lacked strict rules for pronunciation, and they took it as evidence that the languages were more primitive than their own. Boas however noted that the variant pronunciations were not an effect of lack of organization of sound patterns, but an effect of the fact that these languages organized sounds differently from English. The languages grouped sounds that were considered distinct in English into a single sound, but also having contrasts that did not exist in English. He then argued the case that Native Americans had been pronouncing the word in question the same way, consistently, and the variation was only perceived by someone whose own language distinguishes those two sounds. Boas's student, the linguist Edward Sapir later noted that also English speakers pronounce sounds differently even when they think they are pronouncing the same sound, for example few English speakers realize that the sounds written with the letter \u27e8t\u27e9 in the words \"tick\" and \"stick\" are phonetically different, the first being generally affricated and the other aspirated \u2013 a speaker of a language where this contrast is meaningful would instantly perceive them as different sounds and tend not to see them as different realizations of a single phoneme.\nBoas's students drew not only on his engagement with German philosophy. They also engaged the work of contemporary philosophers and scientists, such as Karl Pearson, Ernst Mach, Henri Poincar\u00e9, William James and John Dewey in an attempt to move, in the words of Boas's student Robert Lowie, from \"a naively metaphysical to an epistemological stage\" as a basis for revising the methods and theories of anthropology.\nBoas and his students realized that if they were to conduct scientific research in other cultures, they would need to employ methods that would help them escape the limits of their own ethnocentrism.  One such method is that of ethnography: basically, they advocated living with people of another culture for an extended period of time, so that they could learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture.\nIn this context, cultural relativism is an attitude that is of fundamental methodological importance, because it calls attention to the importance of the local context in understanding the meaning of particular human beliefs and activities.  Thus, in 1948 Virginia Heyer wrote, \"Cultural relativity, to phrase it in starkest abstraction, states the relativity of the part to the whole.  The part gains its cultural significance by its place in the whole, and cannot retain its integrity in a different situation.\"[7]\nAs a heuristic tool\nAnother method was ethnology: to compare and contrast as wide a range of cultures as possible, in a systematic and even-handed manner.  In the late nineteenth century, this study occurred primarily through the display of material artifacts in museums. Curators typically assumed that similar causes produce similar effects; therefore, in order to understand the causes of human action, they grouped similar artifacts together \u2013 regardless of provenance.  Their aim was to classify artifacts, like biological organisms, according to families, genera, and species.  Thus organized museum displays would illustrate the evolution of civilization from its crudest to its most refined forms.\nIn an article in the journal Science, Boas argued that this approach to cultural evolution ignored one of Charles Darwin's main contributions to evolutionary theory:\nIt is only since the development of the evolutional theory that it became clear that the object of study is the individual, not abstractions from the individual under observation.  We have to study each ethnological specimen individually in its history and in its medium ... By regarding a single implement outside of its surroundings, outside of other inventions of the people to whom it belongs, and outside of other phenomena affecting that people and its productions, we cannot understand its meanings ... Our objection ... is, that classification is not explanation.[8]\n\nBoas argued that although similar causes produce similar effects, different causes may also produce similar effects.[9]  Consequently, similar artifacts found in distinct and distant places may be the products of distinct causes. Against the popular method of drawing analogies in order to reach generalizations, Boas argued in favor of an inductive method. Based on his critique of contemporary museum displays, Boas concluded:\nIt is my opinion that the main object of ethnological collections should be the dissemination of the fact that civilization is not something absolute, but that it is relative, and that our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes.[8]\n\nBoas's student Alfred Kroeber described the rise of the relativist perspective thus:[10]\nNow while some of the interest in (so called solial culture science) anthropology in its earlier stages was in the exotic and the out-of-the-way, yet even this antiquarian motivation ultimately contributed to a broader result.  Anthropologists became aware of the diversity of culture.  They began to see the tremendous range of its variations.  From that, they commenced to envisage it as a totality, as no historian of one period or of a single people was likely to do, nor any analyst of his own type of civilization alone.  They became aware of culture as a \"universe\", or vast field in which we of today and our own civilization occupy only one place of many.  The result was a widening of a fundamental point of view, a departure from unconscious ethnocentricity toward relativity.  This shift from naive self-centeredness in one's own time and spot to a broader view based on objective comparison is somewhat like the change from the original geocentric assumption of astronomy to the Copernican interpretation of the solar system and the subsequent still greater widening to a universe of galaxies.\n\nThis conception of culture, and principle of cultural relativism, were for Kroeber and his colleagues the fundamental contribution of anthropology, and what distinguished anthropology from similar disciplines such as sociology and psychology.\nRuth Benedict, another of Boas's students, also argued that an appreciation of the importance of culture and the problem of ethnocentrism demands that the scientist adopt cultural relativism as a method.  Her book, Patterns of Culture, did much to popularize the term in the United States. In it, she explained that:\nThe study of custom can be profitable only after certain preliminary propositions have been violently opposed. In the first place any scientific study requires that there be no preferential weighting of one or another items in the series it selects for its consideration. In all the less controversial fields like the study of cacti or termites or the nature of nebulae, the necessary method of study is to group the relevant material and to take note of all possible variant forms and conditions. In this way we have learned all that we know of the laws of astronomy, or of the habits of the social insects, let us say. It is only in the study of man himself that the major social sciences have substituted the study of one local variation, that of Western civilization.[11]\n\nBenedict was adamant that she was not romanticizing so-called primitive societies; she was emphasizing that any understanding of the totality of humanity must be based on as wide and varied a sample of individual cultures as possible. Moreover, it is only by appreciating a culture that is profoundly different from our own, that we can realize the extent to which our own beliefs and activities are culture-bound, rather than natural or universal.  In this context, cultural relativism is a heuristic device of fundamental importance because it calls attention to the importance of variation in any sample that is used to derive generalizations about humanity.\nAs a critical device\nMarcus and Fischer's attention to anthropology's refusal to accept Western culture's claims to universality implies that cultural relativism is a tool not only in cultural understanding, but in cultural critique.  This points to the second front on which they believe anthropology offers people enlightenment:\nThe other promise of anthropology, one less fully distinguished and attended to than the first, has been to serve as a form of cultural critique for ourselves.  In using portraits of other cultural patterns to reflect self-critically on our own ways, anthropology disrupts common sense and makes us reexamine our taken-for-granted assumptions.[4]\n\nThe critical function of cultural relativism is widely understood; philosopher John Cook observed that \"It is aimed at getting people to admit that although it may seem to them that their moral principles are self-evidently true, and hence seem to be grounds for passing judgement on other peoples, in fact, the self-evidence of these principles is a kind of illusion.\"[12] Although Cook is misconstruing cultural relativism to be identical to moral relativism, his point still applies to the broader understanding of the term.  Relativism does not mean that one's views are false, but it does mean that it is false to claim that one's views are self-evident.\nThe critical function was indeed one of the ends to which Benedict hoped her own work would meet. The most famous use of cultural relativism as a means of cultural critique is Margaret Mead's dissertation research (under Boas) of adolescent female sexuality in Samoa. By contrasting the ease and freedom enjoyed by Samoan teenagers, Mead called into question claims that the stress and rebelliousness that characterize American adolescence is natural and inevitable.\nAs Marcus and Fischer point out, however, this use of relativism can be sustained only if there is ethnographic research in the United States comparable to the research conducted in Samoa. Although every decade has witnessed anthropologists conducting research in the United States, the very principles of relativism have led most anthropologists to conduct research in foreign countries.\nComparison to moral relativism\nAccording to Marcus and Fischer, when the principle of cultural relativism was popularized after World War II, it came to be understood \"more as a doctrine, or position, than as a method\". As a consequence, people misinterpreted cultural relativism to mean that all cultures are both separate and equal, and that all value systems, however different, are equally valid. Thus, people came to use the phrase \"cultural relativism\" erroneously to signify \"moral relativism\".\nPeople generally understand moral relativism to mean that there are no absolute or universal moral standards. The nature of anthropological research lends itself to the search for universal standards (standards found in all societies), but not necessarily absolute standards; nevertheless, people often confuse the two. In 1944 Clyde Kluckhohn (who studied at Harvard, but who admired and worked with Boas and his students) attempted to address this issue:\nThe concept of culture, like any other piece of knowledge, can be abused and misinterpreted. Some fear that the principle of cultural relativity will weaken morality. \"If the Bugabuga do it why can't we? It's all relative anyway.\" But this is exactly what cultural relativity does not mean.\nThe principle of cultural relativity does not mean that because the members of some savage tribe are allowed to behave in a certain way that this fact gives intellectual warrant for such behavior in all groups. Cultural relativity means, on the contrary, that the appropriateness of any positive or negative custom must be evaluated with regard to how this habit fits with other group habits. Having several wives makes economic sense among herders, not among hunters. While breeding a healthy scepticism as to the eternity of any value prized by a particular people, anthropology does not as a matter of theory deny the existence of moral absolutes. Rather, the use of the comparative method provides a scientific means of discovering such absolutes. If all surviving societies have found it necessary to impose some of the same restrictions upon the behavior of their members, this makes a strong argument that these aspects of the moral code are indispensable.[13][14]\n\nAlthough Kluckholn was using language that was popular at the time (e.g. \"savage tribe\") but which is now considered antiquated and coarse by most anthropologists, his point was that although moral standards are rooted in one's culture, anthropological research reveals that the fact that people have moral standards is a universal. He was especially interested in deriving specific moral standards that are universal, although few if any anthropologists think that he was successful.[13]\nThere is an ambiguity in Kluckhohn's formulation that would haunt anthropologists in the years to come. It makes it clear that one's moral standards make sense in terms of one's culture. He waffles, however, on whether the moral standards of one society could be applied to another.  Four years later American anthropologists had to confront this issue head-on.\nIt was James Lawrence Wray-Miller who provided an additional clarification tool, or caveat as some would call it, of cultural relativism's theoretical underpinnings by dividing it into two binary, analytical continuums: vertical and horizontal cultural relativism. Ultimately, these two analytical continuums share the same basic conclusion: that human morality and ethics are not static but fluid and vary across cultures depending on the time period and current condition of any particular culture. \nVertical relativism describes that cultures, throughout history (\"vertical\" meaning passage through past and future), are products of the prevailing societal norms and conditions of their respective historical periods. Therefore, any moral or ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding past cultures' belief systems or societal practices must be firmly\ngrounded and informed by these norms and conditions to be intellectually useful. Vertical relativism also accounts for the possibility that cultural values and norms will necessarily change as influencing norms and conditions change in the future.\nHorizontal relativism describes that cultures in the present (\"horizontal\" in time \u2013 meaning the present period of the culture) are products of the prevailing norms and conditions developed as a result of their unique geographies, histories, and environmental influences. Therefore, moral or\nethical judgments, made during the present, regarding a current culture's belief system or societal practices must account for these unique differences to be intellectually useful.\nStatement on human rights\nThe transformation of cultural relativism as a heuristic tool into the doctrine of moral relativism occurred in the context of the work of the Commission of Human Rights of the United Nations in preparing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nMelville Herskovits prepared a draft \"Statement on Human Rights\" which Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association revised, submitted to the Commission on Human Rights, and then published.[15] The statement begins with a fairly straightforward explanation of the relevance of cultural relativism:\nThe problem is thus to formulate a statement of human rights that will do more than phrase respect for the individual as individual. It must also take into full account the individual as a member of a social group of which he is part, whose sanctioned modes of life shape his behavior, and with whose fate his own is thus inextricably bound.\n \nThe bulk of this statement emphasizes concern that the Declaration of Human Rights was being prepared primarily by people from Western societies, and would express values that, far from being universal, are really Western:\nToday the problem is complicated by the fact that the Declaration must be of world-wide applicability. It must embrace and recognize the validity of many different ways of life. It will not be convincing to the Indonesian, the African, the Chinese, if it lies on the same plane as like documents of an earlier period. The rights of Man in the Twentieth Century cannot be circumscribed by the standards of any single culture, or be dictated by the aspirations of any single people. Such a document will lead to frustration, not realization of the personalities of vast numbers of human beings.\n\nAlthough this statement could be read as making a procedural point (that the Commission must involve people of diverse cultures, especially cultures that had been or are still under European colonial or imperial domination), the document ended by making two substantive claims:\nEven where political systems exist that deny citizens the right of participation in their government, or seek to conquer weaker peoples, underlying cultural values may be called on to bring the peoples of such states to a realization of the consequences of the acts of their governments, and thus enforce a brake upon discrimination and conquest.\nWorldwide standards of freedom and justice, based on the principle that man is free only when he lives as his society defines freedom, that his rights are those he recognizes as a member of his society, must be basic.\nThese claims provoked an immediate response by a number of anthropologists.  Julian Steward (who, as a student of Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie, and as a professor at Columbia University, was situated firmly in the Boasian lineage) suggested that the first claim \"may have been a loophole to exclude Germany from the advocated tolerance\", but that it revealed the fundamental flaw in moral relativism: \"Either we tolerate everything, and keep hands off, or we fight intolerance and conquest \u2013 political and economic as well as military \u2013 in all their forms.\" Similarly, he questioned whether the second principle means that anthropologists \"approve the social caste system of India, the racial caste system of the United States, or many other varieties of social discrimination in the world\".[16] Steward and others[17] argued that any attempt to apply the principle of cultural relativism to moral problems would only end in contradiction: either a principle that seems to stand for tolerance ends up being used to excuse intolerance, or the principle of tolerance is revealed to be utterly intolerant of any society that seems to lack the (arguably, Western) value of tolerance. They concluded that anthropologists must stick to science, and engage in debates over values only as individuals.\nCurrent debates\nThe debates over the Statement on Human Rights, then, was not merely over the validity of cultural relativism, or the question of what makes a right universal.[18] It forced anthropologists to confront the question of whether anthropological research is relevant to non-anthropologists. Although Steward and Barnett seemed to be suggesting that anthropology as such should restrict itself to purely academic affairs, people within and without the academy have continued to debate the ways non-anthropologists have used this principle in public policy concerning ethnic minorities or in international relations.\nPolitical scientist Alison Dundes Renteln has argued that most debates over moral relativism misunderstand the importance of cultural relativism.[19] Most philosophers understand the Benedictine\u2013Herskovitz formulation of cultural relativism to mean\nwhat is right or good for one individual or society is not right or good for another, even if the situations are similar, meaning not merely that what is thought right or good by one is not thought right or good by another ... but that what is really right or good in one case is not so in another.[20]\n\nAlthough this formulation clearly echoes the kinds of example anthropologists used in elaborating cultural relativism, Renteln believes that it misses the spirit of the principle. Accordingly, she supports a different formulation: \"there are or can be no value judgements that are true, that is, objectively justifiable, independent of specific cultures\".[21]\nRenteln faults philosophers for disregarding the heuristic and critical functions of cultural relativism. Her main argument is that in order to understand the principle of cultural relativism, one must recognize the extent to which it is based on enculturation: \"the idea that people unconsciously acquire the categories and standards of their culture\". This observation, which echoes the arguments about culture that originally led Boas to develop the principle, suggests that the use of cultural relativism in debates of rights and morals is not substantive but procedural. That is, it does not require a relativist to sacrifice his or her values. But it does require anyone engaged in a consideration of rights and morals to reflect on how their own enculturation has shaped their views:\nThere is no reason why the relativist should be paralyzed, as critics have often asserted.[22] But a relativist will acknowledge that the criticism is based on his own ethnocentric standards and realizes also that the condemnation may be a form of cultural imperialism.\n\nRenteln thus bridges the gap between the anthropologist as scientist (whom Steward and Barnett felt had nothing to offer debates on rights and morality) and as private individual (who has every right to make value judgements). The individual keeps this right, but the scientist requires that the individual acknowledge that these judgements are neither self-evident universals, nor entirely personal (and idiosyncratic), but rather took form in relation to the individual's own culture.\nPost-colonial politics\nBoas and his students understood anthropology to be a historical, or human science, in that it involves subjects (anthropologists) studying other subjects (humans and their activities), rather than subjects studying objects (such as rocks or stars). Under such conditions, it is fairly obvious that scientific research may have political consequences, and the Boasians saw no conflict between their scientific attempts to understand other cultures, and the political implications of critiquing their own culture.  For anthropologists working in this tradition, the doctrine of cultural relativism as a basis for moral relativism was anathema. For politicians, moralists, and many social scientists (but few anthropologists) who saw science and human interests as necessarily independent or even opposed, however, the earlier Boasian principle of cultural relativism was anathema. Thus, cultural relativism came under attack, but from opposing sides and for opposing reasons.\nPolitical critique\nOn the one hand, many anthropologists began to criticize the way moral relativism, in the guise of cultural relativism, is used to mask the effects of Western colonialism and imperialism. Thus, Stanley Diamond argued that when the term \"cultural relativism\" entered popular culture, popular culture coopted anthropology in a way that voided the principle of any critical function:\nRelativism is the bad faith of the conqueror, who has become secure enough to become a tourist.\nCultural relativism is a purely intellectual attitude; it does not inhibit the anthropologist from participating as a professional in his own milieu; on the contrary, it rationalizes that milieu. Relativism is self-critical only in the abstract. Nor does it lead to engagement. It only converts the anthropologist into a shadowy figure, prone to newsworthy and shallow pronouncements about the cosmic condition of the human race. It has the effect of mystifying the profession, so that the very term anthropologist (\"student of man\") commands the attention of an increasingly \"popular\" audience in search of novelty. But the search for self-knowledge, which Montaigne was the first to link to the annihilation of prejudice, is reduced to the experience of culture shock, a phrase used by both anthropologists and the State Department to account for the disorientation that usually follows an encounter with an alien way of life. But culture shock is a condition one recovers from; it is not experienced as an authentic redefinition of the personality but as a testing of its tolerance ... The tendency of relativism, which it never quite achieves, is to detach the anthropologist from all particular cultures. Nor does it provide him with a moral center, only a job.[23]\n\nGeorge Stocking summarized this view with the observation that \"Cultural relativism, which had buttressed the attack against racialism, [can] be perceived as a sort of neo-racialism justifying the backward techno-economic status of once colonized peoples.\"[24]\nDefense by Clifford Geertz\nOn the other hand, the most common and popular criticisms of relativism come not from anthropologists like Stanley Diamond, but rather from political conservatives. By the 1980s many anthropologists had absorbed the Boasian critique of moral relativism, and were ready to reevaluate the origins and uses of cultural relativism. In a distinguished lecture before the American Anthropological Association in 1984, Clifford Geertz pointed out that the conservative critics of cultural relativism did not really understand, and were not really responding to, the ideas of Benedict, Herskovits, Kroeber and Kluckhohn.[25] Consequently, the various critics and proponents of cultural relativism were talking past one another. What these different positions have in common, Geertz argued, is that they are all responding to the same thing: knowledge about other ways of life.\nThe supposed conflict between Benedict's and Herskovits's call for tolerance and the untolerant passion with which they called for it turns out not to be the simple contradiction so many amateur logicians have held it to be, but the expression of a perception, caused by thinking a lot about Zunis and Dahomys, that the world being so full of a number of things, rushing to judgement is more than a mistake, it is a crime. Similarly, Kroeber's and Kluckholn's verities \u2013 Kroeber's were mostly about messy creatural matters like delirium and menstruation, Kluckholn's were mostly about messy social ones like lying and killing within the in-group, turn out not to be just the arbitrary personal obsessions they so much look like, but the expression of a much vaster concern, caused by thinking a lot about anthr\u014dpos in general, that if something isn't anchored everywhere nothing can be anchored anywhere. Theory here \u2013 if that is what these earnest advices about how we must look at things if we are to be accounted as decent should be called \u2013 is more an exchange of warnings than an analytical debate.  We are being offered a choice of worries.\nWhat the relativists \u2013 so-called \u2013 want us to worry about is provincialism \u2013 the danger that our perceptions will be dulled, our intellects constricted, and our sympathies narrowed by the overlearned and overvalued acceptances of our own society. What the anti-relativists \u2013 self-declared \u2013 want us to worry about, and worry about and worry about, as though our very souls depended on it, is a kind of spiritual entropy, a heat death of the mind, in which everything is as significant, and thus as insignificant, as everything else: anything goes, to each his own, you pays your money and you takes your choice, I know what I like, not in the couth, tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner.\n\nGeertz concludes this discussion by commenting, \"As I have already suggested, I myself find provincialism altogether the more real concern so far as what actually goes on in the world.\"\nGeertz' defense of cultural relativism as a concern which should motivate various inquiries, rather than as an explanation or solution, echoed a comment Alfred Kroeber made in reply to earlier critics of cultural relativism, in 1949:[26]\nObviously, relativism poses certain problems when from trying merely to understand the world we pass on to taking action in the world: and right decisions are not always easy to find. However, it is also obvious that authoritarians who know the complete answers beforehand will necessarily be intolerant of relativism: they should be, if there is only one truth and that is theirs.\nI admit that hatred of the intolerant for relativism does not suffice to make relativism true. But most of us are human enough for our belief in relativism to be somewhat reinforced just by that fact. At any rate, it would seem that the world has come far enough so that it is only by starting from relativism and its tolerations that we may hope to work out a new set of absolute values and standards, if such are attainable at all or prove to be desirable.\n\nUse by nations\nSeveral nations have used cultural relativism as a justification for limiting the rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, despite the World Conference on Human Rights rejecting it as a refugee of human rights violations. A 2011 study by international legal expert Roger Lloret Blackburn, examining the Universal Periodic Reviews, distinguishes several different groups of nations. One group consists of nations where the current regime has been installed by revolution and that deny the need for political plurality: China, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cuba and Iran. Another group are certain Islamic nations that adhere to sharia and certain traditional practices: Yemen, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan. A third possible group is nations that give special rights to specific groups: Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia, and Colombia.[27]\nSee also\nArbitrary culture theory\nCultural Revolution\nEmotivism\nEthnocentrism\nEmic and etic\nGlobal justice\nHistorical particularism\nIntercultural competence\nMoral relativism\nMulticulturalism\nPolitical correctness\nRelativism\nSituational ethics\nUniversality (philosophy)\nXenocentrism\n\n\nFurther reading\nAnkerl, Guy. 2000.

{"question":"Is there a cure for legionellosis?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"passage_indices":[21,21,2],"start_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"yes_no_answer":["YES","YES","YES"]},"context":["\n\nLegionnaires' disease, also known as legionellosis, is a form of atypical pneumonia caused by any type of Legionella bacteria.[4] Signs and symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle pains, and headaches.[3] Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur.[1] This often begins 2-10 days after exposure.[3]\n\nThe bacterium is found naturally in fresh water.[5] It can contaminate hot water tanks, hot tubs, and cooling towers of large air conditioners.[5] It is usually spread by breathing in mist that contains the bacteria.[5] It can also occur when contaminated water is aspirated.[5] It typically does not spread directly between people, and most people who are exposed do not become infected.[5] Risk factors for infection include older age, a history of smoking, chronic lung disease, and poor immune function.[6] Those with severe pneumonia and those with pneumonia and a recent travel history should be tested for the disease.[11] Diagnosis is by a urinary antigen test and sputum culture.[7]\n\nNo vaccine is available.[8] Prevention depends on good maintenance of water systems.[8] Treatment of Legionnaires' disease is with antibiotics.[9] Recommended agents include fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, or doxycycline.[12] Hospitalization is often required.[11] About 10% of those who are infected die.[9]\n\nThe number of cases that occur globally is not known.[1]  Legionnaires' disease is the cause of an estimated 2-9% of pneumonia cases that are acquired outside of hospital.[1] An estimated 8,000 to 18,000 cases a year in the United States require hospitalization.[10] Outbreaks of disease account for a minority of cases.[1][13] While it can occur any time of the year, it is more common in the summer and fall.[10] The disease is named after the outbreak where it was first identified, at a 1976 American Legion convention in Philadelphia.[14]\nSigns and symptoms\nThe length of time between exposure to the bacteria and the appearance of symptoms is generally 2-10 days, but can rarely extend to as long as 20 days.[15] For the general population, among those exposed, between 0.1 and 5.0% develop the disease, while among those in hospital, between 0.4 and 14% develop the disease.[15]\nThose with Legionnaires' disease usually have fever, chills, and a cough, which may be dry or may produce sputum. Almost all experience fever, while around half have cough with sputum, and one-third cough up blood or bloody sputum. Some also have muscle aches, headache, tiredness, loss of appetite, loss of coordination (ataxia), chest pain, or diarrhea and vomiting.[16] Up to half of those with Legionnaires' disease have gastrointestinal symptoms, and almost half have neurological symptoms,[15] including confusion and impaired cognition.[17] \"Relative bradycardia\" may also be present, which is low or low-normal heart rate despite the presence of a fever.[18]\nLaboratory tests may show that kidney functions, liver functions, and electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may include low sodium in the blood. Chest X-rays often show pneumonia with consolidation in the bottom portion of both lungs. Distinguishing Legionnaires' disease from other types of pneumonia by symptoms or radiologic findings alone is difficult; other tests are required for definitive diagnosis.\nPersons with Pontiac fever experience fever and muscle aches without pneumonia. They generally recover in 2-5 days without treatment. For Pontiac fever, the time between exposure and symptoms is generally a few hours to 2 days.\nCause\nOver 90% of cases of Legionnaires' disease are caused by Legionella pneumophila. Other types include L. longbeachae, L. feeleii, L. micdadei, and L. anisa.\nTransmission\nLegionnaires' disease is usually spread by the breathing in of aerosolized water and\/or soil contaminated with the Legionella bacteria.[16] Experts have stated that Legionnaires' disease is not transmitted from person to person.[19] In 2014, one case of possible spread from someone sick to the caregiver occurred.[20] Rarely, it has been transmitted by direct contact between contaminated water and surgical wounds.[16] The bacteria grow best at warm temperatures[5] and thrive at water temperatures between 25 and 45\u00b0C (77 and 113\u00b0F), with an optimum temperature of 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F).[21] Temperatures above 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) kill the bacteria.[22] Sources where temperatures allow the bacteria to thrive include hot water tanks, cooling towers, and evaporative condensers of large air conditioning systems, such as those commonly found in hotels and large office buildings.[23] Though the first known outbreak was in Philadelphia, cases of legionellosis have occurred throughout the world.[15]\nReservoirs\nL. pneumophila thrives in aquatic systems, where it is established within amoebae in a symbiotic relationship.[24] Legionella bacteria survive in water as intracellular parasites of water-dwelling protozoa, such as amoebae. Amoebae are often part of biofilms, and once Legionella and infected amoebae are protected within a biofilm, they are particularly difficult to destroy.[16]\nIn the built environment, central air conditioning systems in office buildings, hotels, and hospitals are sources of contaminated water.[21] Other places the bacteria can dwell include cooling towers used in industrial cooling systems, evaporative coolers, nebulizers, humidifiers, whirlpool spas, hot water systems, showers, windshield washers, fountains, room-air humidifiers, ice-making machines, and misting systems typically found in grocery-store produce sections.[16][25]\nThe bacteria may also be transmitted from contaminated aerosols generated in hot tubs if the disinfection and maintenance programs are not followed rigorously.[26] Freshwater ponds, creeks, and ornamental fountains are potential sources of Legionella.[27] The disease is particularly associated with hotels, fountains, cruise ships, and hospitals with complex potable water systems and cooling systems. Respiratory-care devices such as humidifiers and nebulizers used with contaminated tap water may contain Legionella species, so using sterile water is very important.[28]\nOther sources include exposure to potting mix and compost.[29]\nMechanism\nLegionella spp. enter the lungs either by aspiration of contaminated water or inhalation of aerosolized contaminated water or soil. In the lung, the bacteria are consumed by macrophages, a type of white blood cell, inside of which the Legionella bacteria multiply, causing the death of the macrophage. Once the macrophage dies, the bacteria are released from the dead cell to infect other macrophages. Virulent strains of Legionella kill macrophages by blocking the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes inside the host cell; normally, the bacteria are contained inside the phagosome, which merges with a lysosome, allowing enzymes and other chemicals to break down the invading bacteria.[15]\nDiagnosis\n\nPeople of any age may suffer from Legionnaires' disease, but the illness most often affects middle-aged and older persons, particularly those who smoke cigarettes or have chronic lung disease. Immunocompromised people are also at higher risk. Pontiac fever most commonly occurs in persons who are otherwise healthy.\nThe most useful diagnostic tests detect the bacteria in coughed-up mucus, find Legionella antigens in urine samples, or allow comparison of Legionella antibody levels in two blood samples taken 3-6 weeks apart. A urine antigen test is simple, quick, and very reliable, but only detects L. pneumophila serogroup 1, which accounts for 70% of disease caused by L. pneumophila, which means use of the urine antigen test alone may miss as many as 30% of cases.[21] This test was developed by Richard Kohler in 1982.[30] When dealing with L. pneumophila serogroup 1, the urine antigen test is useful for early detection of Legionnaire's disease and initiation of treatment, and has been helpful in early detection of outbreaks. However, it does not identify the specific subtypes, so it cannot be used to match the person with the environmental source of infection. The Legionella bacteria can be cultured from sputum or other respiratory samples. Legionella spp. stain poorly with Gram stain, stains positive with silver, and is cultured on charcoal yeast extract with iron and cysteine (CYE agar).\nA significant under-reporting problem occurs with legionellosis. Even in countries with effective health services and readily available diagnostic testing, about 90% of cases of Legionnaires' disease are missed. This is partly due to the disease being a relatively rare form of pneumonia, which many clinicians may not have encountered before, thus may misdiagnose. A further issue is that people with legionellosis can present with a wide range of symptoms, some of which (such as diarrhea) may distract clinicians from making a correct diagnosis.[31]\nPrevention\nAlthough the risk of Legionnaires' disease being spread by large-scale water systems cannot be eliminated, it can be greatly reduced by writing and enforcing a highly detailed, systematic water safety plan appropriate for the specific  facility involved (office building, hospital, hotel, spa, cruise ship, etc.)[15] Some of the elements that such a plan may include are:\nKeep water temperature either above or below the 20\u201350\u00b0C (68\u2013122\u00b0F) range in which the Legionella bacterium thrives.\nPrevent stagnation, for example, by removing from a network of pipes any sections that have no outlet (dead ends). Where stagnation is unavoidable, as when a wing of a hotel is closed for the off-season, systems must be thoroughly disinfected just prior to resuming normal operation.\nPrevent the buildup of biofilm, for example, by not using (or by replacing) construction materials that encourage its development, and by reducing the quantity of nutrients for bacterial growth that enter the system.\nPeriodically disinfect the system, by high heat or a chemical biocide, and use chlorination where appropriate. Treatment of water with copper-silver ionization or ultraviolet light may also be effective.[32]\nSystem design (or renovation) can reduce the production of aerosols and reduce human exposure to them, by directing them well away from building air intakes.\nAn effective water safety plan also covers such matters as training, record-keeping, communication among staff, contingency plans, and management responsibilities. The format and content of the plan may be prescribed by public health laws or regulations.[15]\nTreatment\nEffective antibiotics include most macrolides, tetracyclines, ketolides, and quinolones.[16] Legionella spp. multiply within the cell, so any effective treatment must have excellent intracellular penetration. Current treatments of choice are the respiratory tract quinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin) or newer macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin). The antibiotics used most frequently have been levofloxacin, doxycycline, and azithromycin.\nMacrolides (azithromycin) are used in all age groups, while tetracyclines (doxycycline) are prescribed for children above the age of 12 and quinolones (levofloxacin) above the age of 18. Rifampicin can be used in combination with a quinolone or macrolide. Whether rifampicin is an effective antibiotic to take for treatment is uncertain. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend the use of rifampicin with added regimens. Tetracyclines and erythromycin led to improved outcomes compared to other antibiotics in the original American Legion outbreak. These antibiotics are effective because they have excellent intracellular penetration in Legionella-infected cells. The recommended treatment is 5\u201310 days of levofloxacin or 3\u20135 days of azithromycin, but in people who are immunocompromised, have severe disease, or other pre-existing health conditions, longer antibiotic use may be necessary.[16] During outbreaks, prophylactic antibiotics have been used to prevent Legionnaires' disease in high-risk individuals who have possibly been exposed.[16]\nThe mortality at the original American Legion convention in 1976 was high (29 deaths in 182 infected individuals[33]) because the antibiotics used (including penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides) had poor intracellular penetration. Mortality has plunged to less than 5% if therapy is started quickly. Delay in giving the appropriate antibiotic leads to higher mortality.\nPrognosis\nThe fatality rate of Legionnaires' disease has ranged from 5 to 30% during various outbreaks and approaches 50% for nosocomial infections, especially when treatment with antibiotics is delayed.[34] Hospital-acquired Legionella pneumonia has a fatality rate of 28%, and the principal source of infection in such cases is the drinking-water distribution system.[35]\nEpidemiology\n\nLegionnaires' disease acquired its name in July 1976, when an outbreak of pneumonia occurred among people attending a convention of the American Legion at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. Of the 182 reported cases, mostly men, 29 died.[36] On January 18, 1977, the causative agent was identified as a previously unknown strain of bacteria, subsequently named Legionella, and the species that caused the outbreak was named Legionella pneumophila.[37][38]\nOutbreaks of Legionnaires' disease receive significant media attention, but this disease usually occurs in single, isolated cases not associated with any recognized outbreak. When outbreaks do occur, they are usually in the summer and early autumn, though cases may occur at any time of year. Most infections occur in those who are middle-aged or older.[34] National surveillance systems and research studies were established early, and in recent years, improved ascertainment and changes in clinical methods of diagnosis have contributed to an upsurge in reported cases in many countries. Environmental studies continue to identify novel sources of infection, leading to regular revisions of guidelines and regulations. About 8,000 to 18,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease occur each year in the United States, according to the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control.[39]\nBetween 1995 and 2005, over 32,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease and more than 600 outbreaks were reported to the European Working Group for Legionella Infections. The data on Legionella are limited in developing countries and Legionella-related illnesses likely are underdiagnosed worldwide.[15] Improvements in diagnosis and surveillance in developing countries would be expected to reveal far higher levels of morbidity and mortality than are currently recognised. Similarly, improved diagnosis of human illness related to Legionella species and serogroups other than Legionella pneumophila would improve knowledge about their incidence and spread.\nA 2011 study successfully used modeling to predict the likely number of cases during Legionnaires\u2019 outbreaks based on symptom onset dates from past outbreaks. In this way, the eventual likely size of an outbreak can be predicted, enabling efficient and effective use of public health resources in managing an outbreak.[40]\nOutbreaks\n\n\nThe first recognized cases of Legionnaires' disease occurred in 1976 in Philadelphia; among more than 2000 attendees of an American Legion convention held at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, 182 attendees contracted the disease and 29 of them died.[1]\nIn April 1985, 175 people in Stafford, England, were admitted to the District or Kingsmead Stafford Hospitals with chest infection or pneumonia. A total of 28 people died. Medical diagnosis showed that Legionnaires' disease was responsible and the immediate epidemiological investigation traced the source of the infection to the air-conditioning cooling tower on the roof of Stafford District Hospital.\nIn March 1999, a large outbreak in the Netherlands occurred during the Westfriese Flora flower exhibition in Bovenkarspel; 318 people became ill and at least 32 people died. This was the second-deadliest outbreak since the 1976 outbreak and possibly the deadliest, as several people were buried before Legionnaires' disease had been diagnosed.\nThe world's largest outbreak of Legionnaires' disease happened in July 2001 with people appearing at the hospital on July 7, in Murcia, Spain. More than 800 suspected cases were recorded by the time the last case was treated on July 22; 636\u2013696 of these cases were estimated and 449 confirmed (so, at least 16,000 people were exposed to the bacterium) and six died, a case-fatality rate around 1%.\nIn late September 2005, 127 residents of a nursing home in Canada became ill with L. pneumophila. Within a week, 21 of the residents had died. Culture results at first were negative, which is not unusual, as L. pneumophila is a fastidious bacterium, meaning it requires specific nutrients and\/or living conditions to grow. The source of the outbreak was traced to the air-conditioning cooling towers on the nursing home's roof.\nAs of November 12, 2014, 302 people have been hospitalized following an outbreak of Legionella in Portugal and seven related deaths have been reported. All cases, so far, have emerged in three civil parishes from the municipality of Vila Franca de Xira in the northern outskirts of Lisbon, Portugal, and are being treated in hospitals of the Greater Lisbon area. The source is suspected to be located in the cooling towers of the fertilizer plant Fertib\u00e9ria.[41]\nTwelve people were diagnosed with the disease in the Bronx, New York, in December 2014; the source was traced to contaminated cooling towers at a housing development.[42] In July and August 2015, another, unrelated outbreak in the Bronx killed 12 people and made about 120 people sick; the cases arose from a cooling tower on top of a hotel. At the end of September, another person died of the disease and 13 were sickened in yet another unrelated outbreak in the Bronx.[43]  The cooling towers from which the people were infected in the latter outbreak had been cleaned during the summer outbreak, raising concerns about how well the bacteria could be controlled.[44]\nOn August 28, 2015, an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease was detected at San Quentin State Prison in Northern California; 81 people were sickened and the cause was sludge that had built up in cooling towers.[45]\nBetween June 2015 and January 2016, 87 cases of Legionnaires' disease were reported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for the city of Flint, Michigan, and surrounding areas. Ten of those cases were fatal.[46]\nIn November 2017, an outbreak was detected at Hospital de S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier, Lisbon, Portugal, with up to 53 people being diagnosed with the disease and five of them dying from it.[47]\nIn Quincy, Illinois, at the Illinois Veterans home, a 2015 outbreak of the disease killed 12 people and sickened more than 50 others. It was believed to be caused by infected water supply. Three more cases have been identified as of November 2017.[48]\nIn the fall of 2017, 22 cases were reported in a Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Anaheim, CA's Disneyland theme park. It was believed to have been caused by a cooling tower that releases mist for the comfort of visitors. The contaminated droplets likely spread to the people in and beyond the park.[49]\n\n\n\n at Curlie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"87bfe4d0-dd79-421c-8bb9-203280b79c07"}

The result is that both the tractor and semi-trailer will have a distinctly different design than a rigid truck and trailer.\nIt is variously known as a transport in Canada; semi or single in Australia and New Zealand; semi, tractor-trailer, big rig, or eighteen-wheeler in the United States; and articulated lorry, abbreviated artic, in the United Kingdom, Ireland and New Zealand.\nThese vehicles have been criticised on safety grounds, including when a study in London found that they caused a disproportionate number of annual cyclist casualties.[1]\nRegional configurations\nNorth America\n\nIn North America, the combination vehicles made up of a powered truck and one or more semitrailers are known as \"semis\", \"semitrailers\",[2] \"tractor-trailers\", \"big rigs\", \"semi trucks\", \"eighteen-wheelers\", or \"semi-tractor trailers\".\nThe tractor unit typically has two or three axles; those built for hauling heavy-duty commercial-construction machinery may have as many as five, some often being lift axles.\nThe most common tractor-cab layout has a forward engine, one steering axle, and two drive axles. The fifth-wheel trailer coupling on most tractor trucks is movable fore and aft, to allow adjustment in the weight distribution over its rear axle(s).\nUbiquitous in Europe, but less common in North America since the 1990s, is the cabover engine configuration, where the driver sits next to, or over the engine. With changes in the US to the maximum length of the combined vehicle, the cabover was largely phased out of North American over-the-road (long-haul) service by 2007. Cabovers were difficult to service; for a long time the cab could not be lifted on its hinges to a full 90-degree forward tilt, severely limiting access to the front part of the engine.\nAs of 2016, a truck can cost US$100,000, while the diesel fuel cost can be $70,000 per year.[3] Trucks average from 4 to 8 miles per US gallon (59 to 29L\/100km), with fuel economy standards requiring better than 7 miles per US gallon (34L\/100km) efficiency by 2014.[4] Power requirements in standard conditions are 170hp at 55mph (89km\/h) or 280hp at 70mph (113km\/h), and somewhat different power usage in other conditions.[5]\n\n\nThe cargo trailer usually has tandem axles at the rear, each of which has dual wheels, or eight tires on the trailer, four per axle. In the US it is common to refer to the number of wheel hubs, rather than the number of tires; an axle can have either single or dual tires with no legal difference.[6][7] The combination of eight tires on the trailer and ten tires on the tractor is what led to the moniker eighteen wheeler, although this term is considered by some truckers to be a misnomer (the term \"eighteen-wheeler\" is a nickname for a five-axle over-the-road combination). Many trailers are equipped with movable tandem axles to allow adjusting the weight distribution.\nTo connect the second of a set of doubles to the first trailer, and to support the front half of the second trailer, a converter gear known as a \"dolly\" is used. This has one or two axles, a fifth-wheel coupling for the rear trailer, and a tongue with a ring-hitch coupling for the forward trailer. Individual states may further allow longer vehicles, known as \"longer combination vehicles\" (or LCVs), and may allow them to operate on roads other than Interstates.\nLong combination vehicle types include:\nDoubles (officially \"STAA doubles\", known colloquially as \"a set of joints\"): Two 28.5ft (8.7m) trailers.\nTriples: Three 28.5ft (8.7m) trailers.\nTurnpike Doubles: Two 48ft (14.6m) trailers.\nRocky Mountain Doubles: One 40 to 53ft (12.2 to 16.2m) trailer (though usually no more than 48ft (14.6m)) and one 28.5ft (8.7m) trailer (known as a \"pup\").\nIn Canada, a Turnpike Double is two 53ft (16.2m) trailers, and a Rocky Mountain Double is a 50ft (15.2m) trailer with a 24ft (7.3m) \"pup\".\nFuture long combination vehicles under consideration and study for the U.S. MAP-21 transportation bill are container doubles. These combinations are under study for potential recommendation in November 2014:\n40ft (12m) trailer Turnpike Doubles, 148,000lb (67,000kg) GVWR\n40ft (12m) and 20ft (6.1m) trailer Rocky Mountain Doubles, 134,000lb (61,000kg) GVWR\nDouble 20ft (6.1m) trailers.\nThe US federal government, which only regulates the Interstate Highway System, does not set maximum length requirements (except on auto and boat transporters), only minimums. Tractors can pull two or three trailers if the combination is legal in that state. Weight maximums are 20,000lb (9,100kg) on a single axle, 34,000lb (15,000kg) on a tandem, and 80,000lb (36,000kg) total for any vehicle or combination. There is a maximum width of 8.5ft (2.6m) and no maximum height.[8][9]\nRoads other than the Interstates are regulated by the individual states, and laws vary widely. Maximum weight varies between 80,000lb (36,000kg) to 171,000lb (78,000kg), depending on the combination.[10] Most states restrict operation of larger tandem trailer setups such as triple units, turnpike doubles and Rocky-Mountain doubles. Reasons for limiting the legal trailer configurations include both safety concerns and the impracticality of designing and constructing roads that can accommodate the larger wheelbase of these vehicles and the larger minimum turning radii associated with them. In general, these configurations are restricted to the Interstates. Except for these units, double setups are not restricted to certain roads any more than a single setup. They are also not restricted by weather conditions or \"difficulty of operation\".  The Canadian province of Ontario, however, does have weather-related operating restrictions for larger tandem trailer setups.[11]\nEurope\n\nThe noticeable difference between tractor units in Europe and North America is that almost all European models are cab over engine (called \"forward control\" in England[12]), while the majority of North American trucks are \"conventional\" (called \"normal control\" or \"bonneted\" in England[13]).[14]  European trucks, whether straight trucks or fully articulated, have a sheer face on the front. This allows shorter trucks with longer trailers (with larger freight capacity) within the legal maximum total length. Furthermore, it offers greater maneuverability in confined areas, a more balanced weight-distribution and better overall view for the driver. The major disadvantage is that for repairs on COE trucks, the entire cab has to hinge forward to allow maintenance access. Conversely, \"conventional\" cab tractors offer the driver a more comfortable driving environment, easier access getting in or out and better protection in a collision.\nIn Europe usually both rear tractor axles have dual wheels, while single or dual wheels are used for the cargo trailer. The most common combination used in Europe is a semi tractor with three axles, one a lift axle, and a cargo trailer with three axles, one also a lift axle, giving six axles and 22 wheels in total. This format is now common across Europe, due to reduced road-loading requirements, especially for bridges. The lift axles used on both tractors and trailers allow the trucks to remain legal, but increases maneuverability  while at the same time reducing fuel consumption and tyre wear when carrying lighter loads, by raising one or multiple axle set(s) off the roadway. Although lift axles usually operate automatically, they can be lowered manually even while carrying light loads, in order to remain within legal (safe) limits when, for example, navigating back-road bridges with severely restricted axle loads. For greater detail, see the United Kingdom section, below.\nWhen using a dolly, which generally has to be equipped with lights and a license plate, rigid trucks can be used to pull semi-trailers. The dolly is equipped with a fifth wheel to which the trailer is coupled. Because the dolly attaches to a pintle hitch on the truck, maneuvering a trailer hooked to a dolly is different from maneuvering a fifth wheel trailer. Backing the vehicle requires same technique as backing an ordinary truck\/full trailer combination, though the dolly\/semi setup is probably longer, thus requiring more space for maneuvering. The tractor\/semi-trailer configuration is rarely used on timber trucks, since these will use the two big advantages of having the weight of the load on the drive wheels, and the loader crane used to lift the logs from the ground can be mounted on the rear of the truck behind the load, allowing a short (lightweight) crane to reach both ends of the vehicle without uncoupling. Also construction trucks are more often seen in a rigid + midaxle trailer configuration instead of the tractor\/semi-trailer setup.\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the maximum permitted gross weight of a semi-trailer truck, without the use of a Special Type General Order (STGO), is 97,000lb (44t). In order for a 97,000lb semi-trailer truck to be permitted on UK roads the tractor and semi-trailer must have three or more axles each. Lower weight semi-trailer trucks can mean some tractors and trailer having fewer axles.[15] In practice, like double decker buses and coaches in the UK, there is no legal height limit for semi-trailer trucks; however, bridges over 16.5ft (5.03m) do not have the height marked on them. Semi-trailer trucks on Continental Europe have a height limit of 13.1ft (4.0m).\nVehicles heavier than 97,000lb are permitted on UK roads but are indivisible loads, which would be classed as abnormal (or oversize). Such vehicles are required to display an STGO (Special Types General Order) plate on the front of the tractor unit and, under certain circumstances, are required to travel by an authorized route and have an escort.\nMost UK trailers are 45ft (13.7m) long and, dependent on the position of the fifth wheel and kingpin, a coupled tractor unit and trailer will have a combined length of between 50 and 55ft (15.25 and 16.75m). Although the Construction and Use Regulations allow a maximum rigid length of 60ft (18.2m), this, combined with a shallow kingpin and fifth wheel set close to the rear of the tractor unit, can give an overall length of around 75ft (22.75m).[16]\nStarting in January 2012 the Department for Transport is conducting a trial of longer semi-trailers. The trial involves 900 semi-trailers of 48ft (14.6m) in length (i.e. 3ft (1m) longer than the current maximum), and a further 900 semi-trailers of 51ft (15.65m) in length (i.e. 7ft (2.05m) longer). This will result in the total maximum length of the semi-trailer truck being 57ft (17.5m) for trailers 48ft in length, and 61ft (18.55m) for trailers 51ft long. The increase in length will not result in the 97,000lb weight limit being exceeded and will allow some operators to approach the weight limit which may not have been previously possible due to the previous length of trailers. The trial will run for a maximum of 10 years. Providing certain requirements are fulfilled, a Special Types General Order (STGO) allows for vehicles of any size or weight to travel on UK roads. However, in practice any such vehicle has to travel by a route authorized by the Department of Transport and move under escort. The escort of abnormal loads in the UK is now predominantly carried out by private companies, but extremely large or heavy loads that require road closures must still be escorted by the police.\nIn the UK, some semi-trailer trucks have eight tires on three axles on the tractor; these are known as six-wheelers or \"six leggers\", with either the center or rear axle having single wheels which normally steer as well as the front axle and can be raised when not needed (i.e. when unloaded or only a light load is being carried; an arrangement known as a TAG axle when it is the rear axle, or mid-lift when it is the center axle).  Some trailers have two axles which have twin tires on each axle; other trailers have three axles, of which one axle can be a lift axle which has super-single wheels. In the UK, two wheels bolted to the same hub are classed as a single wheel, therefore a standard six-axle articulated truck is considered to have twelve wheels, even though it has twenty tires. The UK also allows semi-trailer truck which have six tires on two axles; these are known as four-wheelers.\n\nIn 2009, the operator Denby Transport designed and built a 83ft  long (25.25m) B-Train (or B-Double) semi-trailer truck called the Denby Eco-Link to show the benefits of such a vehicle, which were a reduction in road accidents and result in less road deaths, a reduction in emissions due to the one tractor unit still being used and no further highway investment being required. Furthermore, Denby Transport asserted that two Eco-Links would replace three standard semi-trailer trucks while, if limited to the current UK weight limit of 97,000lb, it was claimed the Eco-Link would reduce carbon emissions by 16% and could still halve the number of trips needed for the same amount of cargo carried in conventional semi-trailer trucks. This is based on the fact that for light but bulky goods such as toilet paper, plastic bottles, cereals and aluminum cans, conventional semi-trailer trucks run out of cargo space before they reach the weight limit. At 97,000lb, as opposed to 132,000lb usually associated with B-Trains, the Eco-Link also exerts less weight per axle on the road compared to the standard six-axle 97,000lb semi-trailer truck.\nThe vehicle was built after Denby Transport believed they had found a legal-loophole in the present UK law to allow the Eco-Link to be used on the public roads. The relevant legislation concerned the 1986 Road Vehicles Construction and Use Regulations. The 1986 regulations state that \"certain vehicles\" may be permitted to draw more than one trailer and can be up to 85ft (25.9m). The point of law reportedly hinged on the definition of a \"towing implement\", with Denby prepared to argue that the second trailer on the Eco-Link was one. The Department for Transport were of the opinion that this refers to recovering a vehicle after an accident or breakdown, but the regulation does not explicitly state this.\nDuring BTAC performance testing the Eco-Link was given an \"excellent\" rating for its performance in maneuverability, productivity, safety and emissions tests, superseding ordinary semi-trailer trucks in many respects. Private trials had also reportedly shown the Denby vehicle had a 20% shorter stopping distance than conventional semi-trailer trucks of the same weight, due to having extra axles. The active steer system meant that the Eco-Link had a turning circle of 41ft (12.5m), the same as a conventional semi-trailer truck.\nAlthough the Department for Transport advised that the Eco-Link was not permissible on public roads, Denby Transport gave the Police prior warning of the timing and route of the test drive on the public highway, as well as outlining their position in writing to the Eastern Traffic Area Office. On 1 December 2009 Denby Transport were preparing to drive the Eco-Link on public roads, but this was cut short because the Police pulled the semi-trailer truck over as it left the gates in order to test it for its legality \"to investigate any... offenses which may be found\". The Police said the vehicle was unlawful due to its length and Denby Transport was served with a notice by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) inspector to remove the vehicle from the road for inspection. Having returned to the yard, Denby Transport was formally notified by Police and VOSA that the semi-trailer truck could not be used. Neither the Eco-Link, nor any other B-Train, have since been permitted on UK roads. However, this prompted the Department for Transport to undertake a desk study into semi-trailer trucks, which has resulted in the longer semi-trailer trial which commenced in 2012.\nContinental Europe\n\nThe maximum overall length in the EU and EEA member states was 18.75m (61.5ft) with a maximum weight of 40tonnes, or 44tonnes if carrying an ISO container.[17] However, rules limiting the semi-trailers to 16.5m (54ft) and 18.75m are met with trucks carrying a standardized 7.82m (26ft) body with one additional 7.82m body on tow as a trailer.[18] 25.25metre truck combinations were developed under the branding of EcoCombi which influenced the name of EuroCombi for an ongoing standardization effort where such truck combinations shall be legal to operate in all jurisdictions of the European Economic Area. With the 50% increase in cargo weight, the fuel efficiency increases with an average of 20% with a corresponding relative decrease in carbon emissions and with the added benefit of one third fewer trucks on the road.[17] The 1996 EU regulation defines a Europe Module System (EMS) as it was implemented in Sweden. The wording of EMS combinations and EuroCombi are now used interchangeably to point to truck combinations as specified in the EU document; however, apart from Sweden and Finland, the EuroCombi is only allowed to operate on specific tracks in other EU member states.  Since 1996, when Sweden and Finland formally won a final exemption from the European Economic Area rules with 60tonne and 25.25m (83ft) combinations, all other From 2006, 25.25m truck trailer combinations are to be allowed on restricted routes within Germany, following a similar (on-going) trial in The Netherlands. Similarly, Denmark has allowed 25.25m combinations on select routes. These vehicles will run a 60tonne weight limit. Two types are to be used: 1) a 26-tonne truck pulling a dolly and semi-trailer, or 2) an articulated tractor unit pulling a B-double, member states gained the ability to adopt the same rules. In Italy the maximum permitted weight (unless exceptional transport is authorized) is 44 tonnes for any kind of combination with five axles or more.\nThe tractor\/semi-trailer configuration is rarely used on timber trucks, since these will use the two big advantages of having the weight of the load on the drive wheels, and the loader crane used to lift the logs from the ground can be mounted on the rear of the truck behind the load, allowing a short (lightweight) crane to reach both ends of the vehicle without uncoupling. Also construction trucks are more often seen in a rigid + midaxle trailer configuration instead of the tractor\/semi-trailer setup.\nScandinavia\n\nDenmark and Norway allow 25.25m (83ft) trucks (Denmark from 2008, and Norway from 2008 on selected routes). In Sweden the allowed length has been 24m (79ft) since 1967. Before that, the maximum length was unlimited; the only limitations were on axle load. What stopped Sweden from adopting the same rules as the rest of Europe, when securing road safety, was the national importance of a competitive forestry industry.[17][19] Finland, with the same road safety issues and equally important forestry industry, followed suit. The change made trucks able to carry three stacks of cut-to-length logs instead of two, as it would be in a short combination. They have one on stack together with a crane on the 6\u00d74 truck, and two additional stacks on a four axle trailer. The allowed gross weight in both countries is up to 60 tonnes depending on the distance between the first and last axle.\nIn the negotiations starting in the late 1980s preceding Sweden and Finland's entries to the European Economic Area and later the European Union, they insisted on exemptions from the EU rules citing environmental concerns and the transportation needs of the logging industry. In 1995, after their entry to the union, the rules changed again, this time to allow trucks carrying a standard CEN unit of 7.82m (26ft) to draw a 13.6m (45ft) standard semi-trailer on a dolly, a total overall length of 25.25m. Later, B-double combinations came into use, often with one 6m (20ft) container on the B-link and a 12m (40ft) container (or two 6m containers) on a semi-trailer bed. In allowing the longer truck combinations, what would take two 16.5m (54ft) semi-trailer trucks and one 18.75m (62ft) truck and trailer to haul on the continent now could be handled by just two 25.25m trucks \u2013 greatly reducing overall costs and emissions. Prepared since late 2012 and effective on January 2013, Finland has changed its regulations to allow total maximum legal weight of a combination to be 76tonnes. At the same time the maximum allowed height would be increased by 20cm (8in); from current maximum of 4.2m (13.8ft) to 4.4m (14.4ft). The effect this major maximum weight increase would cause to the roads and bridges in Finland over time is strongly debated.\nHowever, longer and heavier combinations are regularly seen on public roads; special permits are issued for special cargo. The mining company Boliden AB have a standing special permit for 80tonne combinations on select routes between mines in the inland and the processing plant in Boliden, taking a 50tonne load of ore. Volvo has a special permit for a 32m (105ft), steering B-trailer-trailer combination carrying two 12m (40ft) containers to and from Gothenburg harbour and the Volvo Trucks factory, all on the island of Hisingen.[20] Another example is the ongoing project En Trave Till (lit. One more pile\/stack) started in December 2008. It will allow even longer vehicles to further rationalize the logging transports. As the name of the project points out, it will be able to carry four stacks of timber, instead of the usual three. The test is limited to Norrbotten county and the European route E4 between the timber terminal in \u00d6verkalix and the sawmill in Munksund (outside Pite\u00e5). The vehicle is a 30m (98ft) long truck trailer combination with a gross weight exceeding 90tonnes. It is estimated that this will give a 20% lower cost and 20-25% CO2 emissions reduction compared to the regular 60tonne truck combinations. As the combinations spreads its weight over more axles, braking distance, road wear and traffic safety is believed to be either the same or improved with the 90tonne truck-trailer. In the same program two types of 74tonne combinations will be tested in Dalsland and Bohusl\u00e4n counties in western Sweden: an enhanced truck and trailer combination for use in the forest and a b-double for plain highway transportation to the mill in Skoghall. In 2012, the Northland Mining company received permission for 90tonne combinations with normal axle load (an extra dolly) for use on the 150km (93mi) Kaunisvaara-Svappavaara route, carrying iron ore.[21][22][23]\nAs of 2015, the longest and heaviest truck in everyday use in Finland is operated by transport company Ketosen Kuljetus as part of a pilot project studying transport efficiency in the timber industry. The combined vehicle is 33-metre (108ft) long, has 13 axles, and weighs a total of 104 tonnes (229,000lb).[24][25]\nStarting from Jan 21 2019 Finland Government change the maximum allowed length of truck from 25,25 meters to 34,50 meters. New types of vehicle combinations that differ from the current standards may also be used on the road. The requirements for combinations also include camera systems for side visibility, an advanced emergency braking and lane detector system, electronic driving stability system and electronically controlled brakes.  \nAustralasia\nAustralia\n\nAustralian road transport has a reputation for using very large trucks and road trains. This is reflected in the most popular configurations of trucks generally having dual drive axles and three axles on the trailers, with four tyres on each axle. This means that Australian single semi-trailer trucks will usually have 22 tyres, which is generally more than their counterparts in other countries. Super single tyres are sometimes used on tri-axle trailers. The suspension is designed with travel limiting, which will hold the rim off the road for one blown or deflated tyre for each side of the trailer, so a trailer can be driven at reduced speed to a safe place for repair. Super singles are also often used on the steer axle in Australia to allow greater loading over the steer axle. The increase in loading of steer tyres requires a permit.\nLong haul transport usually operates as B-doubles with two trailers (each with three axles), for a total of nine axles (including steering). In some lighter duty applications only one of the rear axles of the truck is driven, and the trailer may have only two axles. From July 2007, the Australian Federal and State Governments allowed the introduction of B-triple trucks on a specified network of roads.[26] B-Triples are set up differently from conventional road trains. The front of their first trailer is supported by the turntable on the prime mover. The second and third trailers are supported by turntables on the trailers in front of them. As a result, B-Triples are much more stable than road trains and handle exceptionally well. True road trains only operate in remote areas, regulated by each state or territory government.\nIn total, the maximum length that any articulated vehicle may be (without a special permit and escort) is 53.5m (176ft), its maximum load may be up to 164tonnes gross, and may have up to four trailers. However, heavy restrictions apply to the areas where such a vehicle may travel in most states. In remote areas such as the Northern Territory great care must be taken when sharing the road with longer articulated vehicles that often travel during the daytime, especially four-trailer road trains.\nArticulated trucks towing a single trailer or two trailers (commonly known as \"short doubles\") with a maximum overall length of 19m (62ft) are referred to as \"General access heavy vehicles\" and are permitted in all areas, including metropolitan. B-doubles are limited to a maximum total weight of 62.5tonnes and overall length of 25m (82ft), or 26m (85ft) if they are fitted with approved FUPS (Front Underrun Protection System) devices. B-doubles may only operate on designated roads, which includes most highways and some major metropolitan roads. B-doubles are very common in all parts of Australia including state capitals and on major routes they outnumber single trailer configurations.\nMaximum width of any vehicle is 2.5m (8.2ft) and a height of 4.3m (14ft). In the past few years, allowance has been made by several states to allow certain designs of heavy vehicles up to 4.6m (15ft) high but they are also restricted to designated routes. In effect, a 4.6meter high B-double will have to follow two sets of rules: they may access only those roads that are permitted for B-doubles and for 4.6meter high vehicles.\nIn Australia, both conventional prime movers and cabovers are common, however, cabovers are most often seen on B-doubles on the eastern seaboard where the reduction in total length allows the vehicle to pull longer trailers and thus more cargo than it would otherwise.\n\nAn Australian prime mover Kenworth and B double trailer combination\nA road train in Australia\nB-double truck on the Sturt Highway\n\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand's legislation governing truck dimensions falls under the Vehicle Dimensions and Mass Rules published by NZ Transport Agency.[27] New rules were introduced effective 1 February 2017.[28] which increased the maximum height, width and weight of loads and vehicles to simplify regulations, increase the amount of freight carried and to improve the range of vehicles and trailers available to transport operators. \nCommon combinations in New Zealand consist of a standard semi-trailer, a B-double or a rigid towing vehicle pulling a trailer with a drawbar. Standard maximum vehicle lengths for trailers with one axle set are:\nSemi-trailer: 19m (62ft)\nSimple: 22m (72ft)\nPole: 20m (66ft)\nTrailers with two axle sets can be 20m (66ft), including heavy rigid vehicles towing two trailers.\nOversized loads require, at minimum, a permit, and may require a pilot vehicle.[29]\nConstruction\n\nTypes of trailers\n\nThere are many types of semi-trailers in use, designed to haul a wide range of products.\n\nBox, or dry van\nBus\nContainer\nRefrigerator, or \"reefer\"\nTanker\nDry bulk\nFlatbed\nLowboy\nCar hauler\nDump\n\nCoupling and uncoupling\nThe cargo trailer is, by means of a king pin, hooked to a horseshoe-shaped quick-release coupling device called a fifth wheel or a turntable hitch at the rear of the towing engine that allows easy hook up and release. The truck trailer cannot move by itself because it only has wheels at the rear end: it requires a forward axle, provided by the towing engine, to carry half the load weight.  When braking hard at high speeds, the vehicle has a tendency to fold at the pivot point between the towing vehicle and the trailer. Such a truck accident is called a \"trailer swing\", although it is also commonly described as a \"jackknife\".[30] Jackknifing is a condition where the tractive unit swings round against the trailer, and not vice versa.\nBraking\n\nSemi trucks use air pressure, rather than hydraulic fluid, to actuate the brake. The use of air hoses allows for ease of coupling and uncoupling of trailers from the tractor unit. The most common failure is brake fade, usually caused when the drums or discs and the linings of the brakes overheat from excessive use.\nThe parking brake of the tractor unit and the emergency brake of the trailer are spring brakes that require air pressure in order to be released. They are applied when air pressure is released from the system, and disengaged when air pressure is supplied. This is a fail-safe design feature which ensures that if air pressure to either unit is lost, the vehicle will stop to a grinding halt, instead of continuing without brakes and becoming uncontrollable. The trailer controls are coupled to the tractor through two gladhand connectors, which provide air pressure, and an electrical cable, which provides power to the lights and any specialized features of the trailer.\nGlad-hand connectors (also known as palm couplings) are air hose connectors, each of which has a flat engaging face and retaining tabs. The faces are placed together, and the units are rotated so that the tabs engage each other to hold the connectors together. This arrangement provides a secure connection but allows the couplers to break away without damaging the equipment if they are pulled, as may happen when the tractor and trailer are separated without first uncoupling the air lines. These connectors are similar in design to the ones used for a similar purpose between railroad cars. Two air lines typically connect to the trailer unit. An emergency or main air supply line pressurizes the trailer's air tank and disengages the emergency brake, and a second service line controls the brake application during normal operation.\nIn the UK, male\/female quick release connectors (red line or emergency), have a female on the truck and male on the trailer,  but a yellow line or service has a male on the truck and female on the trailer. This avoids coupling errors (causing no brakes) plus the connections will not come apart if pulled by accident. The three electrical lines will fit one way around a primary black, a secondary green, and an ABS lead, all of which are collectively known as suzies or suzie coils.\nAnother braking feature of semi-trucks is engine braking, which could be either a compression brake (usually shortened to Jake brake) or exhaust brake or combination of both. However, the use of compression brake alone produces a loud and distinctive noise, and to control noise pollution, some local municipalities have prohibited or restricted the use of engine brake systems inside their jurisdictions, particularly in residential areas. The advantage to using engine braking instead of conventional brakes is that a truck can descend a long grade without overheating its wheel brakes. Some vehicles can also be equipped with hydraulic or electric retarders which have an advantage of near silent operation.\nTransmission\n\nBecause of the wide variety of loads the semi may carry, they usually have a manual transmission to allow the driver to have as much control as possible. However, all truck manufacturers now offer semi-automatic transmissions (manual gearboxes with automated gear change), as well as automatic transmissions.\nSemi-truck transmissions can have as few as three forward speeds or as many as 18 forward speeds (plus 2 reverse speeds). A large number of transmission ratios means the driver can operate the engine more efficiently. Modern on-highway diesel engines are designed to provide maximum torque in a narrow RPM range (usually 1200-1500 RPM); having more gear ratios means the driver can hold the engine in its optimum range regardless of road speed (drive axle ratio must also be considered).\nA ten-speed manual transmission, for example is controlled via a six-slot H-box pattern, similar to that in five-speed cars \u2014 five forward and one reverse gear. Gears six to ten (and high speed reverse) are accessed by a Lo\/High range splitter; gears one to five are Lo range; gears six to ten are High range using the same shift pattern. A Super-10 transmission, by contrast, has no range splitter; it uses alternating \"stick and button\" shifting (stick shifts 1-3-5-7-9, button shifts 2-4-6-8-10).  The 13-, 15-, and 18-speed transmissions have the same basic shift pattern, but include a splitter button to enable additional ratios found in each range. Some transmissions may have 12 speeds.\nAnother difference between semi-trucks and cars is the way the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch brake stops the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.\nLights\nAn electrical connection is made between the tractor and the trailer through a cable often referred to as a pigtail. This cable is a bundle of wires in a single casing. Each wire controls one of the electrical circuits on the trailer, such as running lights, brake lights, turn signals, etc. A straight cable would break when the rig went around corners, so a coiled cable is used which retracts these coils when not under tension. It is these coils that cause the cable to look like a pigtail.\nIn most countries, a trailer or semi-trailer must have minimum\n2 rear lights (red)\n2 stop lights (red)\n2 turning lights; one for right and one for left, flashing (amber; red optional in North America)\n2 marking lights behind if wider than certain specifications (red; plus a group of 3 red lights in the middle in North America)\n2 marking lights front if wider than the truck or wider than certain specifications (white; amber in North America)\nWheels and tires\nAlthough dual wheels are the most common, use of two single, wider tires, known as super singles, on each axle is becoming popular among bulk cargo carriers and other weight-sensitive operators. With increased efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the use of the super-single tire is gaining popularity. There are several advantages to this configuration. The first of these is that super singles reduce fuel consumption. In 1999, tests on an oval track showed a 10% fuel savings when super singles were used. These savings are realized because less energy is wasted flexing fewer tire sidewalls. Second, the lighter overall tire weight allows a truck to be loaded with more freight. The third advantage is that the single wheel encloses less of the brake unit, which allows faster cooling and reduces brake fade.\nOne of the major disadvantages of the super singles is that they are currently not as widely available as a standard tire. In addition, if a tire should become deflated or be destroyed, there is not another tire attached to the same hub to maintain the dynamic stability of the vehicle, as would be the case with dual wheels. With dual wheels, the remaining tire may be overloaded, but it will typically allow the vehicle to be safely stopped or driven to a repair facility.\nIn Europe, super singles became popular when the allowed weight of semitrailer rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes.[31] In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10-tonne (22,000lb) axles with dual wheels, with three 8-tonne (18,000lb) axles on wide-base single wheels. The significantly lower axle weight on super singles must be considered when comparing road wear from single versus dual wheels. The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385mm (15.2in). The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4,500kg (9,900lb). (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5,000kg (11,000lb) do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.)\nSkirted trailers\n\nAn innovation rapidly growing in popularity is the skirted trailer. The space between the road and the bottom of the trailer frame was traditionally left open until it was realized that the turbulent air swirling under the trailer is a major source of aerodynamic drag. Three split skirt concepts were verified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide fuel savings greater than 5%, and four split skirt concepts had EPA-verified fuel savings between 4% and 5%.[32]\nSkirted trailers are often combined with Underrun Protection Systems (underride guards), greatly improving safety for passenger vehicles sharing the road.\nUnderride guard\n\n\nTechnically called a Rear Underrun Protection System (RUPS), this is a rigid assembly hanging down from the bottom rear of the trailer, which is intended to provide some protection for passenger cars which collide with the rear of the trailer. Public awareness of this safeguard was increased in the aftermath of the accident that killed actress Jayne Mansfield on 29 June 1967, when the car she was in hit the rear of a tractor-trailer, causing fatal head trauma. After her death, the NHTSA recommended requiring a rear underride guard, also known as a Mansfield bar, an ICC bar, or a DOT bumper,[33][34]. In Europe, side and rear underrun protection are mandated on all lorries and trailers with a gross weight of 3,500kg or more.[35]\nThe bottom rear of the trailer is near head level for an adult seated in a car, and without the underride guard, the only protection for such an adult's head in a rear-end collision would be the car's windshield. The front of the car goes under the platform of the trailer rather than making contact via the passenger car bumper, so the car's protective crush zone becomes irrelevant and air bags are ineffective in protecting the car passengers. The underride guard provides a rigid area for the car to contact at the height of its bumper.\nIn addition to rear underride guards, truck tractor cabs may be equipped with a Front Underrun Protection System (FUPS) at the front bumper of the truck, if the front end is not low enough for the bumper to provide the adequate protection on its own.  The safest tractor-trailers are also equipped with side underride guards, also called Side Underrun Protection System (SUPS). These additional barriers prevent passenger cars from skidding underneath the trailer from the side, such as in an oblique or side collision, or if the trailer jackknifes across the road.  In addition to safety benefits, these underride guards may improve fuel mileage by reducing air turbulence under the trailer at highway speeds.\nAnother benefit of having a sturdy underride guard is that it may be secured to a loading dock with a hook to prevent \"trailer creep\", a movement of the trailer away from the dock, which opens up a dangerous gap during loading or unloading operations.[36]\nSemi-truck manufacturers\nCurrent semi-truck manufacturers include:\nUnited States and Canada\n\nCaterpillar\nCrane Carrier Company\nFord\nFreightliner\nHino Motors (Canadian plant)\nKenworth\nMack\nNavistar International\nOshkosh\nPeterbilt\nTesla\nVolvo\nWestern Star\n\nEurope\n\nADR Group Trailer\nDAF Trucks\nIveco\nKamaz\nKrAZ\nMAN\nMAZ\nMercedes-Benz\nRenault Trucks\nScania\nSisu\nTatra\nVolvo\nZiL\n\nAsia\/Pacific\n\nAsia MotorWorks\nC&C Trucks (China)\nCAMC Star (China)\nChina National Heavy Duty Truck Group\nFAW Group (China)\nFoton Motor (China)\nHino Motors\nHyundai\nIsuzu\nMahindra Truck and Bus Division\nMitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation\nTata Daewoo\nTata Motors\nUD Trucks\n\nOther locations\n\nAl Kowary Industries (Bahrain)\nAshok Leyland (India)\nBharatBenz (India)\nBMC (Turkey)\nEicher Motors (India)\nVolkswagen Caminh\u00f5es e \u00d4nibus (Latin America, South Africa)\n\nDriver's license\n\nA special driver's license is required to operate various commercial vehicles.\nCanada\nRegulations vary by province. A license to operate a vehicle with air brakes is required (i.e., normally a Class I, II, or III commercial license with an \"A\" or \"S\" endorsement in provinces other than Ontario). In Ontario, a \"Z\" endorsement[37] is required to drive any vehicle using air brakes; in provinces other than Ontario, the \"A\" endorsement is for air brake operation only, and an \"S\" endorsement is for both operation and adjustment of air brakes. Anyone holding a valid Ontario driver's license (i.e., excluding a motorcycle license) with a \"Z\" endorsement can legally drive any air-brake-equipped truck-trailer combination with a registered- or actual-gross-vehicle-weight (i.e., including towing- and towed-vehicle) up to 11tonnes, that includes one trailer weighing no more than 4.6tonnes if the license falls under the following three classes: Class E (school bus\u2014maximum 24-passenger capacity or ambulance), F (regular bus\u2014maximum 24-passenger capacity or ambulance) or G (car, van, or small-truck).\nA Class B (any school bus), C (any urban-transit-vehicle or highway-coach), or D (heavy trucks other than tractor-trailers) license enables its holder to drive any truck-trailer combination with a registered- or actual-gross-vehicle-weight (i.e., including towing- and towed-vehicle) greater than 11tonnes, that includes one trailer weighing no more than 4.6tonnes.[38] Anyone holding an Ontario Class A license (or its equivalent) can drive any truck-trailer combination with a registered- or actual-gross-vehicle-weight (i.e., including towing- and towed-vehicles) greater than 11 tonnes, that includes one or more trailers weighing more than 4.6 tonnes.\nUnited States\nDrivers of semi-trailer trucks generally require a Class A commercial driver's license (CDL) to operate any combination vehicles with a gross combination weight rating (or GCWR) in excess of 26,000lb (11,800kg) if the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the towed vehicle(s) is in excess of 10,000lb (4,500kg). Some states (such as North Dakota) provide exemptions for farmers, allowing non-commercial license holders to operate semis within a certain air-mile radius of their reporting location. State exemptions, however, are only applicable in intrastate commerce; stipulations of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) may be applied in interstate commerce.  Also a person under the age of 21 cannot operate a commercial vehicle outside the state where the commercial license was issued.  This restriction may also be mirrored by certain states in their intrastate regulations.  A person must be at least 18 in order to be issued a commercial license.\nIn addition, endorsements are necessary for certain cargo and vehicle arrangements and types;\nH \u2013 Hazardous Materials (HazMat or HM) \u2013 necessary if materials require HM placards.\nN \u2013 Tankers \u2013 the driver is acquainted with the unique handling characteristics of liquids tankers.\nX \u2013 Signifies Hazardous Materials and Tanker endorsements, combined.\nT \u2013 Doubles & Triples \u2013 the licensee may pull more than one trailer.\nP \u2013 Buses \u2013 Any Vehicle designed to transport 16 or more passengers (including the driver).\nS \u2013 School Buses \u2013 Any school bus designed to transport 11 or more passengers (including the driver).\nW \u2013 Tow Truck\nTaiwan\n\nThe Road Traffic Security Rules (\u9053\u8def\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u898f\u5247) require a combination vehicle driver license (Chinese:\u806f\u7d50\u8eca\u99d5\u99db\u57f7\u7167) to drive a combination vehicle (Chinese:\u806f\u7d50\u8eca). These rules define a combination vehicle as a motor vehicle towing a heavy trailer, i.e., a trailer with a gross weight of more than 750 kilograms (1,653lb).\nEurope\nA category CE driving licence is required to drive a tractor-trailer in Europe. Category C (\u0393 in Greece) is required for vehicles over 7,500kg (16,500lb), while category E is for heavy trailers, which in the case of trucks and buses means any trailer over 750kg (1,650lb). Vehicles over 3,500kg (7,700lb)\u2014which is the maximum limit of B license\u2014but under 7,500 kg can be driven with a C1 license. Buses require a D (\u0394 in Greece) license. A bus that is registered for no more than 16 passengers, excluding the driver, can be driven with a D1 license.\nAustralia\nTruck drivers in Australia require an endorsed license. These endorsements are gained through training and experience. The minimum age to hold an endorsed license is 18years, and\/or must have held open (full) driver's license for minimum 12months.\nThe following are the heavy vehicle license classes in Australia:\nLR (Light Rigid) \u2013 Class LR covers a rigid vehicle with a GVM (gross vehicle mass) of more than 4.5tonnes but not more than 8 tonnes. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9tonnes GVM. Also includes vehicles with a GVM up to 8 tonnes which carry more than 12 adults including the driver and vehicles in Class C.\nMR (Medium Rigid) \u2013 Class MR covers a rigid vehicle with two axles and a GVM of more than 8 tonnes. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9tonnes GVM. Also includes vehicles in Class LR.\nHR (Heavy Rigid) \u2013 Class HR covers a rigid vehicle with three or more axles and a GVM of more than 15 tonnes. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9tonnes GVM. Also includes articulated buses and vehicles in Class MR.\nHC (Heavy Combination) \u2013 Class HC covers heavy combination vehicles like a prime mover towing a semi-trailer, or rigid vehicles towing a trailer with a GVM of more than 9 tonnes. Also includes vehicles in Class HR.\nMC (Multi Combination) \u2013 Class MC covers multi-combination vehicles like road trains and B-double vehicles. Also includes vehicles in Class HC.\nIn order to obtain an HC License the driver must have held an MR or HR license for at least 12 months. To upgrade to an MC License the driver must have held a HR or HC license for at least 12 months. From licenses MR and upward there is also a B Condition which may apply to the license if testing in a synchromesh or automatic transmission vehicle. The B Condition may be removed upon the driver proving the ability to drive a constant mesh transmission using the clutch. Constant mesh transmission refers to crash box transmissions, predominantly Road Ranger eighteen-speed transmissions in Australia.\nNew Zealand\nIn New Zealand, drivers of heavy vehicles require specific licenses, termed as classes. A Class 1 license (car license) will allow the driving of any vehicle with Gross Laden Weight (GLW) or Gross Combination Weight (GCW) of 6,000kg (13,000lb) or less. For other types of vehicles the classes are separately licensed as follows:\nClass 2 \u2013 Medium Rigid Vehicle: Any rigid vehicle with GLW 18,001kg (39,685lb) or less with light trailer of 3,500kg (7,700lb) or less, any combination vehicle with GCW 12,001kg (26,458lb) or less, any rigid vehicle of any weight with no more than two axles, or any Class 1 vehicle.\nClass 3 \u2013 Medium Combination Vehicle: Any combination vehicle of GCW 25,001kg (55,118lb) or less, or any Class 2 vehicle.\nClass 4 \u2013 Heavy Rigid Vehicle: Any rigid vehicle of any weight, any combination vehicle which consists of a heavy vehicle and a light trailer, or any vehicle of Class 1 or 2 (but not 3).\nClass 5 \u2013 Heavy Combination Vehicle: Any combination vehicle of any weight, and any vehicle covered by previous classes.\nClass 6 \u2013 Motorcycle.\nFurther information on the New Zealand licensing system for heavy vehicles can be found at the .\nRole in trade\nModern day semi-trailer trucks often operate as a part of a domestic or international transport infrastructure to support containerized cargo shipment.\nVarious types of rail flat bed train cars are modified to hold the cargo trailer or container with wheels or without. This is called Intermodal or piggyback. The system allows the cargo to switch from highway to railway or vice versa with relative ease by using gantry cranes.\nThe large trailers pulled by a tractor unit come in many styles, lengths, and shapes. Some common types are: vans, reefers, flatbeds, sidelifts and tankers. These trailers may be refrigerated, heated, ventilated, or pressurized, depending on climate and cargo. Some trailers have movable wheel axles that can be adjusted by moving them on a track underneath the trailer body and securing them in place with large pins. The purpose of this is to help adjust weight distribution over the various axles, to comply with local laws.\nMedia\n\nTelevision\n1960s TV series Cannonball\nNBC ran two popular TV series about truck drivers in the 1970s featuring actor Claude Akins in major roles:\nMovin' On (1974\u20131976)\nB.

{"question":"Who founded the Burntisland Shipbuilding Company?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[778,778,778],"passage_indices":[2,2,2],"start_positions":[748,757,757],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","NONE","NONE"]},"context":["\n\nThe Burntisland Shipbuilding Company was a shipbuilder and repairer in Burntisland, Fife, Scotland that was founded in 1918.[1] In 1969 it was taken over by Robb-Caledon Shipbuilders, which in turn was nationalised in 1977 as part of British Shipbuilders.\nIn the 1970s the Burntisland yard switched from shipbuilding to prefabricating modules of superstructure for offshore oil platforms, but orders were intermittent and by the 1980s the yard was largely idle. In 1990 new owners returned the yard to production as Burntisland Fabrications or BiFab, resuming the manufacture of superstructure modules for oil platforms. Under a management buyout in 2001 the Burntisland yard returned to being an independent company.[2]\nFounding and early years\nBrothers Amos and Wilfrid Ayre founded Burntisland Shipbuilding Co. in 1918 as a First World War emergency shipyard.[1] Its yard at Burntisland West Dock had four berths and capacity to build ships up to 450 feet (140m) long[1] and up to 59 feet (18m) beam.[3] However, until the 1950s Burntisland built relatively few vessels more than about 425 feet (130m) long and 57 feet (17.4m) beam.[3]\nThe yard was connected to the North British Railway by an extensive internal rail network that carried steel to various parts of the yard.[1]\nBurntisland's first three vessels were standard \"C\" type cargo ships[1] of just over 3,100 GRT each for the UK Government's wartime Shipping Controller, laid down in 1918 as hull numbers 101, 102 and 103.[3] They were launched in 1919 after the Armistice: hull 101 in June as War Brosna, 102 in September as War Dodder and 103 in November as War Tolka.[3]\nBurntisland's first peacetime order was for a pair of 2,300 GRT cargo steamers for Compagnie Lasry of Oran, Algeria.[3] Hulls 104 and 105 were launched in 1920 as Nelly Lasry and Sidney Lasry.[3] In the 1920s the yard built merchant ships ranging from coasters of about 600 tons to ocean-going cargo ships of up to 4,700 tons GRT.[3] Most common were ocean-going four- or five-hold[1] tramp steamers of 1,500 to 2,500 tons.[3]\nThe yard also built a number of arch-deck colliers[3] from 900 to 2,300 tons GRT.[3] Burntisland built numerous flatiron colliers with low superstructures, hinged funnel and hinged or telescopic mast(s) to fit under bridges upriver from the Pool of London on the River Thames.[1] Burntisland's first flatiron was hull 119, launched in 1922 as the 932 GRT coastal collier Wandle for the Wandsworth, Wimbledon and Epsom District Gas Company.[3] From 1923 to 1946 Burntisland built a further 11 colliers for the same customer, which from 1932 was called the Wandsworth and District Gas Company.[3]\nSurviving the Great Depression\nBeing built in 1918 the yard was modern, well-equipped and thus well-placed to compete during the Great Depression. In 1929 the company introduced its\n\"Burntisland Economy\" ship design, intended for maximum fuel efficiency.[1] The concept was popular with ship-owners during the depression and Burntisland continued the design with a succession of developments during the 1930s.[1]\nSome ships that Burntisland built for shipping companies went on to become Empire ships under the Ministry of War Transport in the Second World War. Hull 164, launched in 1935 as Roxburgh, became Empire Tower in 1942. Hull 207, launched in 1937 as Ginnheim, became Empire Ouse in 1945.[3]\nBurntisland continued to build numerous colliers. Hulls 171 and 172, launched in 1932 as Alexander Kennedy and Ferranti, were a pair of 1,315 GRT flatirons for the London Power Company,[3] which operated Battersea Power Station and Deptford Power Station. Burntisland went on to build six further colliers for the LPC between 1933 and 1945.[3]\n\nHull 173 was launched in 1932 as Wandle, a 1,482 GRT flatirons for the Wandsworth, Wimbledon and Epsom District Gas Company.[3] She replaced the previous Wandle that Burntisland had built for the same owner in 1922 (see above).[3]\nHull 174 was launched in 1933 as London Queen, a 781 GRT coaster for the London and Channel Islands Shipping Company.[3] Her owners became British Channel Islands Shipping Co, for whom Burntisland launched a further seven ships between 1937 and 1948.[3]\nHulls 178 and 179, launched in 1933 and 1934 as Pulborough and Petworth, were for Stephenson, Clarke and Associates.[3] Burntisland went on to build eight ships for Stephenson, Clarke spread over nearly 30 years, the last being hull 398 launched in 1961 as MV Gilsland.[3]\nHull 184, launched in 1934 as MV<i>Charles M, was Burntisland's first diesel ship.[3] She was a 403 GRT coaster with a Humboldt-Deutz engine and was built for T.J. Metcalf of London.[3] Burntisland built a second Humboldt-Deutz-engined motor coaster for Metcalf, hull 196, that was launched in 1936 as MV<i>Daniel M.[3]\nHulls 191 and 192, launched in 1935 as Corbrae and Corburn, were for William Cory & Son.[3] Over the next 21 years Burntisland went on to build a total of 17 colliers for Cory, the last two being hulls 376 and 378 launched in 1956 as MV Corstar and MV Corsea.[3]\nHulls 193\u2013195 were a trio of flatirons launched in successive years as Fulham in 1935, Fulham II in 1936 and Fulham III in 1937.[3] They were built for the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham[3] to supply Fulham Power Station. Burntisland went on to build six further flatirons for Fulham between 1938 and 1948.[3]\nHull 213, launched in 1938 as MV Derrymore, was a 4,799 GRT cargo ship for McCowen and Gross of London.[3] Burntisland went on to build a further five ships for McCowen and Gross between 1938 and 1951.[3]\nSecond World War\n\n\n\nDuring the Second World War Burntisland continued to concentrate on building merchant ships.[1] However, in 1943 it also built three Loch-classfrigates:[1] HMS<i>Loch Fyne, HMS<i>Loch Killin and HMS<i>Loch Glendhu.[3]\nIn May 1941 Burntisland launched hull 233 as Merton, the first of several large standard-design 7,195 GRT cargo ships for the Carlton Steam Ship Co of Newcastle upon Tyne.[3] War shipping needs and losses called for an unprecedented rate of shipbuilding.[3] In July, August and October 1941 Burntisland launched three further large ships of the same standard design for Carlton.[3] They included Earlston, which was torpedoed and sunk off the North Cape in July 1942 less than a year after her launch.[3] Burntisland launched a further two large ships per year for Carlton in 1942\u201344.[3]\nAlso in 1941, Burntisland started to build colliers for the Gas Light and Coke Company to supply Beckton Gas Works in east London. Hull 235 was launched in April as the 2,816 GRT Adams Beck.[3] Burntisland went on to build five further colliers for the GL&CC in the 1940s.[3]\nIn 1942 Burntisland launched hull 264 as the 7,043 GRT cargo ship MV Highland Prince for Prince Line.[3] In 1944 hull 280 was launched as the 7,150 GRT MV Scottish Prince.[3] Burntisland went on to build eight further merchant ships for Prince line between 1946 and 1960.[3]\nBurntisland built a number of war standard ships for the Ministry of War Transport, including the 7,290 GRT hulls 261 and 266 launched as Empire Rosalind and Empire Glory in 1942 and 1943.[3] Other MoWT orders included two merchant aircraft carriers: hull 268 launched in 1942 as MV<i>Empire MacAlpine and hull 277 launched in 1943 as MV<i>Empire MacKendrick.[3] Hulls 291 to 294 were launched in February and March 1944 as CHANT 66 to CHANT 69: part of the large CHANT fleet of 400 GRT prefabricated coastal tankers.[3]\nWartime demand rose so high that in 1944\u201345 Burntisland subcontracted orders for five coasters to Hall, Russell & Company of Aberdeen: hulls 270, 273, 274, 276 and 281.[3]\nIn April 1945 Burntisland launched hull 290, the 7,541 GRT Padana for the British-India Steam Navigation Company.[3] BI ordered two more cargo ships from Burntisland after the war (see below).\nCompletion of MoWT orders continued after the surrender of Germany with the launches of hull 298 in May 1945 as the 1,337 GRT coaster Empire Pacific and finally hull 289 in July as the 7,134 GRT cargo ship MV Empire Calshot.[3]\nPost-war production\nBurntisland continued to build colliers after the war. Hulls 295 and 301, launched in 1946 as Chessington and Mitcham, were the last two flatirons for the Wandsworth and District Gas Co. Hull 328 was launched in 1948 as MV Adams Beck for the GL&CC.[3] Under the Gas Act 1948 the Wandsworth and District Gas Co became part of South Eastern Gas Board, whom Burntisland supplied with five further flatirons between 1949 and 1956.[3]\nHulls 307 and 308, launched in 1947 and 1948 as the 1,776 GRT MV Fulham VIII and 1,759 GRT MV Fulham IX,[3] were the last two flatirons for Fulham Borough Council before the Electricity Act 1947 nationalised Britain's electricity supply industry. Burntisland supplied one collier for the new state-owned British Electricity Authority: hull 341, launched in 1951 as the 1,837 GRT Brimsdown,[3] named after Brimsdown Power Station in north London.\nBurntisland maintained its reputation for high quality tramps and cargo-liners.[1] By 1945 a majority of orders were for motor vessels.[3] Hulls 316 and 317 were a pair of 3,668 GRT sister ships for British-India S.N. Co launched in 1948 as MV<i>Warora and MV<i>Warla.[3] Each had a Barclay Curle-Doxford three-cylinder diesel engine.[3]\nHulls 319\u2013321 were launched for the newly founded Christensen Canadian African Lines as the 3,623 GRT MV Thorshall in May 1948, 3,632 GRT MV Thorstrand in December 1948 and 3,713 GRT MV Thorsisle in March 1949.[3] Each ship had a Hawthorn Leslie-Doxford four-cylinder diesel engine.[3]\nHull 330 was launched in 1949 as MV Sycamore, a 3,343 GRT cargo ship for Johnston Warren Lines of Liverpool.[3] Further orders from Johnston Warren Lines were hulls 353 and 355 launched in 1954 as the 3,596 GRT MV Beechmore and 3,597 GRT MV Pinemore, and hull 385 launched in 1958 as the 6,659 GRT cargo ship MV Mystic.[3]\nHulls 334 and 335 were a pair of 3,364 GRT cargo liners for Prince line, launched in 1950 as MV<i>Afric Prince and MV<i>Egyptian Prince.[3] Each ship had a 300 BHP Hawthorn Leslie four-cylinder diesel engine, a top speed of 14 knots (26km\/h) and accommodation for 12 passengers.[3]\nHull 337 was launched in February 1951 as MV Derrymore, a 5,678 GRT cargo ship that replaced one of the same name that Burntisland built for the same customer in 1938.[3] Before the end of 1951 the new Derrymore passed to O. Gross's Power Steam Ship Co as MV Huntsmore.[3] Burntisland built three further ships for Power S.S. Co between 1954 and 1958.[3]\nHull 349 was launched in September 1952 as MV Master Nicos, an 8,453 GRT cargo ship for Motores Maritimos Compa\u00f1\u00eda Limitada, a Greek-owned company registered in Costa Rica.[3] From February 1952 until her launch the resident engineer supervising Master Nicos' construction was Victoria Drummond MBE, the first British woman to have qualified as a marine engineer.[4]\nDuring and after the Second World War the demand for larger cargo ships increased. Burntisland's slipways and berths were limited in size, but in the 1950s the yard managed to build a number of ships of more than 450 feet (140m) length and 60 feet (18.3m) beam.[3] Hull 347, launched in 1954 as the 6,515 GRT MV<i>Huntsland for Power S.S. Co, had a length and beam of 477 feet (145m) and 64 feet (19.5m).[3] Hull 362, launched in 1956 as the 8,390 GRT (11,850 DWT) MV<i>Capetan Cardemalitis for the Tramp Chartering Corporation of Piraeus, had a length, beam and draught of 479 feet (146m), 63 feet (19.2m) and 28 feet (8.5m).[3]\nHull 367, launched in October 1956 as the 1,873 GRT MV Kingston, was the final flatiron collier for the South Eastern Gas Board. She also turned out to be the last of 28 flatirons that Burntisland had built for various customers over a period of 34 years.[3]\nIn the 1950s The Scottish and Mercantile Investment Co bought a majority shareholding in the company.[1] However, the Ayre brothers continued to manage the business.[1]\nBy the mid-1950s orders were sufficient for Burntisland to subcontract two coasters to Hall Russell in Aberdeen. In 1956 Hall Russell launched hull 378 as the 3,373 GRT MV Corsea for Wm. Cory.[3] Hull 379 was launched in Aberdeen as Winga for Glen and Company of Glasgow and completed in 1957.[3] Winga proved to be Burntisland's last steam-powered ship.[3]\nTurbine steamers\nIn the 1950s there were far fewer orders for ships with reciprocating steam engines. However, geared steam turbines are more compact, more powerful and less vibratory than reciprocating engines. Early in the 1950s Burntisland took two orders for steam turbine cargo ships.\nThe first order was for a pair of ore carriers for the Panamanian Pan Ore Steam Ship Co, Inc.[3] Hull 352 was launched in 1953 as the 5,000 GRT TSS<i>Dispatcher.[3] Her sister ship hull 351 was launched in 1954 as the 4,952 GRT TSS<i>Discoverer.[3] David Rowan and Company of Glasgow, part of Lithgows Limited,[5] built the turbines and reduction gearing for both ships.[3]\nThe second turbine order was hull 377, launched in 1956 as TSS<i>Sunvictor for Skibs A\/S Geirulv (Gjeruldsen & Tambs) of Arendal, Norway.[3] Her turbine was built by Scotts of Greenock on the River Clyde.[3]\nCancellations and redundancies\nIn the 1950s Burntisland suffered a number of cancelled orders. Hull 365 was cancelled in 1954 and hull 368 in 1955, but worse came with the cancellation of six hulls in 1959\u201360.[3] The first three cancelled hulls were all for Power S.S. Co. in about 1959.[3] The last cancellation was hull 396 for Prince Line in about 1960.[3] This left hull 395, launched as the 4,800 GRT MV Lancastrian Prince, as Burntisland's last completed order for Prince Line.\nBy 2 July 1959 Burntisland Shipbuilding had laid off 100 workers and it was rumoured in the House of Commons that the company was to close down.[6] On 30 October 1959 a new Labour MP, Harry Gourlay, whose Kirkcaldy Burghs constituency included Burntisland, made his maiden speech to the House of Commons.[7] In it he reported that in 1957 about 1,700 people had been employed in shipyards in Kirkcaldy and Burntisland but this workforce had now been reduced to about 800.[7]\nOn 26 July 1962 Harry Gourlay again expressed concern in the Commons that Burntisland Shipbuilding had made a number of its employees redundant.[8] However, the Conservative MP Frederick Erroll, President of the Board of Trade, replied that the redundancies had not increased unemployment in Burntisland.[8]\nOn 5 November 1962 Gourlay told the Commons that he blamed the Conservative Government's economic policy for the decline of shipbuilding in the United Kingdom.[9] William Whitelaw MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour, denied this and replied that the Ministry of Labour planned to create a centre in Fife to retrain redundant workers for alternative employment.[9]\nOn 14 March and 27 May 1963 and Gourlay told the Commons that Burntisland Shipbuilding had cut its workforce from about 1,500 in 1961 to just over 500 in 1963.[10][11] (An alternative source states that in 1961 Burntisland had 1,000 employees.)[1] On 14 March Gourlay pleaded for small shipyards on the east coast of Scotland such as Burntisland to be awarded War Department contracts[10] and on 27 May he claimed in the Commons that the Local Employment Act had not led to the creation of any new jobs in Burntisland.[11] Whitelaw conceded that the number of shipyard workers unemployed in Burntisland had risen from six in May 1961 to 116 in May 1963.[11]\nIn 1963 Sir Wilfrid Ayre retired after 45 years at the head of the company.[1]\n1960s production\nMetcalf Motor Coasters renewed its relationship with Burntisland by ordering five new coastal tankers: hull 399 launched in 1961 as MV Ann M, hull 404 launched in 1962 as MV John M, hull 410 launched in 1964 as MV Frank M, hull 411 launched in 1965 as MV Nicholas M and finally hull 417 launched in 1966 as MV Eileen M.[3]\nBurntisland succeeded in securing orders from notable customers. Hull 402, launched in 1962 as MV Montreal City and hull 406, launched in 1964 as MV Halifax City were sister ships of just over 6,500 GRT for Bristol City Line.[3] Hull 403, launched in 1962 as MV Beaverpine, was a 4,514 GRT cargo ship for Canadian Pacific Steamships.[3] Hulls 407 and 408, launched in 1964 as MV Newfoundland and MV Nova Scotia, were a pair of 6,660 GRT sister ships for Furness Withy.[3]\nHulls 414 and 415 were also coastal tankers, built as specialist liquid gas carriers.[3] The sister ships were launched for the Nile Steam Ship Co as MV Teviot in 1965 and MV Traquair in 1966 respectively.[3] Burntisland also built a larger tanker, hull 416, launched in 1965 as the 3,971 GRT MV Olau Mark for Olau Line of Denmark.\nMV Ohrmazd and receivership\nHull 418 was launched in April 1967 as the 11,046 GRT MV<i>Ohrmazd, a fast passenger and cargo liner for the East & West Steamship Company of Karachi, Pakistan.[12] However, protracted negotiations with Ohrmazd's owners over the ship's specification delayed her completion until November 1968.[12] This activated a penalty clause in the building contract from which Burntisland Shipbuilding proved unable to recover,[12] and the company went into receivership in 1968.[1]\nOn 20 December 1968 the Burntisland yard was facing closure and a Conservative MP, James Prior, told the Commons that he hoped it could be averted,[13] but on 22 January 1969 the announcement was made that the yard would close.[14] The next day, 23 January, the Commons debated the Labour Government's Shipbuilding Industry Bill. The Labour MP Gerald Fowler, Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Technology, told the House:\n\"We in the Ministry of Technology have spared no effort to find, if we can, a commercial solution to this problem to keep this yards in shipbuilding, and the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy Burghs (Mr. Gourlay) has made as strenuous an effort to save this yard, as could be expected of any constituency Member, and all credit is due to him for that, and I hope that his efforts and ours will be rewarded with success.\"[14]\nUnder the Shipbuilding Act 1967 the Labour Government offered credit to help the shipbuilding industry. Therefore, during 23 January debate Edward Garrett, Labour MP for Wallsend asked the Minister of Technology, Tony Benn MP, about Burntisland Shipbuilding, \"Is it true that since the credit facilities became available little attempt has been made by management, and, I fear, by the Minister, to ascertain whether the medium and small yards are being helped to become more economic?\"[14]\nA day later, 24 January, the Scottish National Party MP Winnie Ewing asked in the Commons if the Ministry of Technology would form a government holding company to buy the Burntisland yard and keep it and all its employees at work.[15] Gerald Fowler said that it would not, and \"the best hope of a long-term solution would be if a shipbuilding undertaking which can find orders capable of being carried out profitably at this yard were to take it over\".[15]\nOn 29 January in the Commons Willie Hamilton, Labour MP for West Fife, called for a public enquiry into the causes of the Burntisland yard's closure.[16] In his reply, Gerald Fowler said:\n\"I hope that we can reach a commercial and viable solution which will enable the yard to stay in production. However, I must point out that the assistance voted by this House in the Shipbuilding Industry Act was meant to be used not to save uneconomic yards but to assist reorganisation with a view to promoting competitiveness in the industry. If the Burntisland yard fits that pattern, I shall be pleased, but I do not think that an inquiry would help us as of now.\"[16]\nFinal ships\nBurntisland launched four more ships after launching Ohrmazd. Hull 419, launched in 1967 as MV Peter Schr\u00f6der and hull 420, launched in 1968 as MV Paul Schr\u00f6der, were a pair of cargo ships each of just over 5,000 GRT for Reederei Richard Schr\u00f6der of Hamburg, Germany. Hull 421, launched in 1968 as MV Christiane Bolten, was a similar cargo ship for another Hamburg customer, the long-established August Bolten William Miller's Nachfolger. Hull 422 was the yard's final vessel, another cargo ship similar to the Peter Schr\u00f6der and Paul Schr\u00f6der. She was launched in April 1969 as MV<i>Helen Miller[3] for the St. Vincent Shipping Co. of Liverpool and completed ahead of schedule that July.[12] The yard then made about 800 of its remaining workers redundant.[17]\nOn 30 April 1970, during another Shipbuilding Bill debate in the Commons, the Liberal MP Jo Grimond asked \"Is there any news about the site at Burntisland? ... I understand that it is out of shipbuilding. Is it out of the industry altogether? Is it being used on prefabrication or for any other purpose?\"[18] Harold Lever MP, Paymaster General, replied that the Burntisland yard \"is now satisfactorily in the East Scotland Group and quite active.\" Grimond immediately asked \"Will it build again?\", to which Lever replied \"I think it is building now. It is functioning well in another reasonably successful group.\"[18]\nBurntisland's new owner was Robb-Caledon Shipbuilders of Leith and Dundee. On 31 January 1972 Gourlay told the Commons \"Now there are only 80 persons employed there [i.e. at Burntisland yard], and even their jobs are in jeopardy unless something is done very soon.\"[17] His Labour colleague Dick Douglas MP added:\n\"My hon. Friend indicates a specific problem. It may be that the good offices of the Department can be used to ensure that some of the work that Robb Caledon takes on board is dispersed not only to the Burntisland yard but to the Dundee yard, in view of the present high level of unemployment. The male rate is running at 12.3 per cent., and the local figure is 9.8 per cent. of the insured population of Dundee and Broughty Ferry.\"[17]\nBurntisland still built no more ships, and on 11 February 1972 Robb-Caledon made another 10 workers at Burntisland redundant[19] In the Commons on 6 March 1972 Gourlay again pleaded for Government money to help keep the yard open.[20] The Conservative MP Nicholas Ridley replied that the Department for Trade and Industry had no proposals to help Robb-Caledon.[20] Robb-Caledon eventually removed Burntisland's equipment to its other yards.[1][12]\nOffshore oil and gas fabrications\nRobb-Caledon eventually succeeded in attracting orders to build structures for Scotland's North Sea oil and natural gas industry. By December 1972 Burntisland was building a structure for Shell's Auk oilfield.[21] This was followed in 1973 by an order for modules for North Sea oil platforms.[22] By November 1974 Robb-Caledon had formed a Burntisland Engineering Fabricators (BEF) subsidiary and the yard was building modules for the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, but Gourlay complained in the Commons that the yard had lost a potential order for an oil rig to an overseas competitor for reasons of cost and \"the geographical conditions on the site\".[23]\nIn April 1975 John Smith MP, Under-Secretary of State for the Department of Energy told the Commons that BEF was one of the UK's two largest constructors for the offshore oil and gas industry.[24] It had not secured orders for offshore platforms but had become the UK's leading builder of modules to fit on them.[24] In December 1975 Gregor Mackenzie MP, a minister at the Department of Industry told the Commons that his department had lent BEF \u00a3450,000 under the Industry Act 1972, had given its parent company Robb-Caledon a \u00a3400,000 loan and almost \u00a31.1 million in grants and the company was also eligible for grants under the Local Employment Act.[25]\nNationalisation and closure\n\nUnder the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 the Labour Government nationalised the UK's shipbuilding industry. Robb-Caledon became a wholly owned subsidiary of British Shipbuilders, which thereby held a 52% share in BEF.[26]\nOn 7 January 1979 Burntisland was nearing completion of its current order and Gourlay asked in the Commons whether the Secretary of State for Industry \"will hold discussions to ensure the continuing operation of the yard at Burntisland when the present contract is completed\".[27] Les Huckfield MP replied on behalf of the Secretary of State \"Although there are no further orders in prospect for the yard, British Shipbuiders is using its best endeavours to sell the yard as a going concern, thereby preserving employment\".[27]\nOn 24 October 1979 Gourlay told the Commons of the closure of the Burntisland yard and asked what George Younger MP, Secretary of State for Scotland would do to help the unemployed to find to re-employment.[28]\nRevival\nIn 1990 under new owners Burntisland West Dock resumed the production of major offshore oil and gas fabrications. In 2001 a management buyout took over the yard as Burntisland Fabrications or BiFab. The company now also owns a yard at Methil[2] in Fife and a facility at Arnish on Lewis in the Outer Hebrides.[29]\nFootball club\n\nIn 1919 a recreation fund was established, funded by a weekly subscription from the workers' wages. The fund created a cricket team, bowls team and two football teams. In 1925 the football teams were constituted as Burntisland Shipyard Amateur F.C., and since 1929 the club has competed in the qualifying stages of the Scottish Cup. The club is a member of the Kingdom Caledonian Football League.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nPhotograph of  on Picasa web albums\nPhotograph of  on ShipsAndHarbours.com\nPhotograph of  on Shipspotting.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"15c91780-6a51-4832-a3ee-b37bb7b2de62"}
{"question":"What was Jemima Harrison's first film production?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"passage_indices":[-1,-1,-1],"start_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","NONE","NONE"]},"context":["Main Page\n\nThe Family That Walks On All Fours is a BBC Two documentary  that explored the science and the story of five individuals in the Ulas family, a Kurdish family in Southeastern Turkey that walk with a previously unreported quadruped gait.[1][2][3][4]\nThe documentary about the Kurdish family in Turkey was created by Passionate Productions and was broadcast on 17 March 2006. The narrator is Jemima Harrison. A revised version of the documentary that shifts the focus away from the story of the discovery of the family and includes the views of additional scientists was shown on NOVA on 14 November 2006.[5]\nBackground\nDebate exists as to the nature and cause of the family's walking, including controversial speculation in the form of the Uner Tan syndrome that it may be a genetic throwback to pre-bipedal hominid locomotion. However, Nicholas Humphrey, who accompanied the documentary makers, concluded that it was due to a rare set of genetic and developmental circumstances coming together. First, their mother recalls that initially all of her 19 children started off walking with a bear-crawl (i.e. on their feet rather than their knees). Second, due to an inherited recessive genetic mutation, they have a non-progressive congenital cerebellar ataxia that impairs the balance children normally use to learn to walk bipedally. Not being able to manage the balance needed for bipedal walking, they perfected in its place their initial bear-crawl into an adult quadruped gait. The family's walking likely has nothing to do with genes involved in the human evolution of upright walk.\nSynopsis\nIn June 2005, Nicholas Humphrey receives a call from Dr. John Skoyles who has seen an unpublished paper by Turkish Professor Uner Tan that focuses upon hand dominance in the family. \nIn the film, Two British scientists and Tan visit the family and their father, Resit. There are 19 children in the family, 12 of them typical, and seven were handicapped, one of whom died.  The commentary first introduces G\u00fclin and notes that he \"staggers as if he's drunk\" but walks on two feet. Then each of the affected hand-walking individuals is introduced: the four sisters Safiye, Hacer, Senem and Emine, and their brother, H\u00fcseyin.\nContrasting with these scenes of sadness, we then see the family enjoying themselves at a sandy beach only an hour\u2019s drive away. In spite of its nearness, they have never been to the sea before. They are shown paddling and touching the sea waves. Hatice, their mother, upon seeing the sea for the first time in her life, says that she did not know that Allah had made such beauty.\nThe narrator explains that it has been explained to the family that the film will put the world\u2019s spotlight on them. Resit says does not want them compared to monkeys. He does not believe in evolution but also he philosophically observes words cannot harm them and film might bring help and a little understanding. Professor Nicholas Humphrey expresses his concern that this phenomenon may never be seen again.\nIn January 2006, the film makers return to the family. Before they left, parallel bars had been bought on Dr. Ali\u2019s advice and put outside so the family could exercise upright walking and they have done this nearly every day. The family is seen smiling as they have made progress in learning to walk - and the film closes with H\u00fcseyin walking up a path on two legs.\nProduction crew\nWriter, director, narrator and editor: Jemima Harrison\nPhotographer and producer: Jon Lane\nComputer model: Premog\nTitles: Alex Pritchard\nAdditional photography: Darren Hercher\nProduction Assistant: Chloe Hayward\nAdditional Research: David Boardman\nArchive researcher: Elizabeth Ashe\nColourist: Malcom Merdith\nDubbing mixer: Matt Skilton\nOnline Editor: Jim Dummett\nExecutive Producer for BBC: Richard Klein\nConsultants, Turkey: Defne Aruoba, Cetin Mursalio\u011flu\nConsultants, UK: Nick Humphrey, Roger Keynes, John Skoyles\nSee also\nKnuckle-walking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumphrey, N., Keynes, R. & Skoyles, J.

{"question":"How many dogs die from dog fighting?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"passage_indices":[-1,-1,-1],"start_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","NONE","NONE"]},"context":["\n\nDog fighting is a type of blood sport generally defined as two or more game dogs against one another in a ring or a pit for the entertainment of the spectators or the gratification of the dogfighters, who are sometimes referred to as dogmen.[1]\nIn rural areas, fights are often staged in barns or outdoor pits; in urban areas, fights may occur in garages, basements, warehouses, abandoned buildings, back alleys, neighborhood playgrounds, or in the streets.[2][3] Dog fights usually last until one dog is declared a winner, which occurs when one dog fails to scratch, one dog dies, or one dog jumps out of the pit.[4] Sometimes dog fights end without declaring a winner; for instance, the dog's owner may call the fight.[4]\nDog fighting generates revenue from stud fees, admission fees and gambling. Worldwide, several countries have banned dog fighting, but it is still legal in some countries like Japan, Honduras, and parts of Russia.[2]\nEuropean history\n\n\n\nBlood sports in general can be traced back to the Roman Empire.[5] In 13 BC, for instance, the ancient Roman circus slew 600 African beasts.[6] Likewise, under Emperor Claudius's reign, as spectators cheered, 300 bears and 300 Libyan beasts were slain in the Colosseum.[6] Dog fighting, more specifically, can also be traced to ancient Roman times. In 43 AD, for example, dogs fought alongside the Romans and the British in the Roman Conquest of Britain.[5] In this war, the Romans used a breed that originated from Greece called Molossus; the Britons used broad-mouth Mastiffs, which were thought to descend from the Molossus bloodline and which also originated from Greece.[7] Though the British were outnumbered and ultimately lost this war, the Romans were so impressed with the English Mastiffs that they began to import these dogs for use in the Colosseum, as well as for use in times of war.[5] While spectators watched, the imported English Mastiffs were pitted against animals such as wild elephants, lions, bears, bulls, and gladiators.[5]\nLater, the Romans bred and exported fighting dogs to Spain, France and other parts of Europe until eventually these dogs made their way back to England.[5] Though bull baiting and bear baiting were popular throughout the Middle Ages up to the 19th century in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, the British pitted dogs against bulls and bears on a scale like no other.[7] In 12th century England during the feudal era, the landed aristocracy, who held direct military control in decentralized feudal systems and thus owned the animals necessary for waging war, introduced bull baiting and bear baiting to the rest of the British population.[7] In later years, bull baiting and bear baiting became a popular source of entertainment for the British royalty.[7] For instance, Queen Elizabeth I, who reigned from 1558\u20131603, was an avid follower of bull and bear baiting; she bred Mastiffs for baiting and would entertain foreign guests with a fight whenever they visited England.[7] In addition to breeding Mastiffs and entertaining foreign guests with a fight, Queen Elizabeth, and later her successor, King James I, built a number of bear gardens in London.[8] The garden buildings were round and roofless, and housed not only bears, but also bulls and other wild animals that could be used in a fight.[8] Today, a person can visit the Bear Garden museum near the Shakespeare Global Complex in Bankside, Southwark.\nWith the popularity of bull and bear baiting, bears needed for such fights soon became scarce.[7] With the scarcity of bear population, the price of bears rose and, because of this, bull baiting became more common in England over time.[7] Bulls who survived the fights were slaughtered afterwards for their meat, as it was believed that the fight caused bull meat to become more tender.[7] In fact, if a bull was offered for sale in the market without having been baited the previous day, butchers were liable to face substantial fines.[7] Animal fights were temporarily suspended in England when Oliver Cromwell seized power, but were reinstated again after the Restoration.[8] Dog fighting, bear baiting, and bull baiting were officially outlawed in England by the Humane Act of 1835.[2] The official ban on all fights, however, actually served to promote dog fighting in England.[8] Since a small amount of space was required for the pit where a dog fight took place, as compared to the ring needed for bull or bear baiting, authorities had a difficult time enforcing the ban on dog fighting.[8]\nU.S. history\nIn 1817, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier dog breed was brought to America and dog fighting slowly became part of American culture.[1] Yet, though historical accounts of dog fighting in America can be dated back to the 1750s, it was not until the end of the Civil War (1861\u20131865) that widespread interest and participation in the blood sport began in the United States.[3] For instance, in 1881, the Mississippi and Ohio railroads advertised special fares to a dog fight in Louisville; public forums such as Kit Burns' Tavern, \"The Sportman's Hall,\" in Manhattan regularly hosted matches.[1] Many of these dogs thrown into the \"professional pits\" that flourished during the 1860s came from England and Ireland\u2014where citizens had turned to dogs when bear-baiting and bull-baiting became illegal in their countries.[3]\nIn twentieth century America, despite the expansion of laws to outlaw dog fighting, dog fighting continued to flourish underground.[3] Aiding in the expansion of dog fighting were the police and firemen, who saw dog fighting as a form of entertainment amongst their ranks.[3] In fact, the Police Gazette served as a \"go to\" source for information about where one could attend a fight.[3] When Henry Bergh, who started the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), witnessed police involvement in these fights, he was motivated to seek and receive authority for the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Agents to have arresting power in New York.[3] Additionally, Bergh's 1867 revision to New York's animal cruelty law made all forms of animal fighting illegal.[3] However, According to the ASPCA website, the Humane Law Enforcement department of ASPCA has been disbanded and NYPD has taken over its duty.[3] As laws were passed to outlaw the activity, high-profile organizations, such as the United Kennel Club, who once endorsed the sport by formulating rules and sanctioning referees, withdrew their endorsement.[1]\nOn July 8, 2009, the ASPCA also participated in one of the largest federal dog fighting raids in U.S. history. Most of the dogs rescued were pit bulls (over 400 of them). This raid took place in eight states and had 26 arrests, of which two defendants are required to spend at least 10 years in prison.[9]\nBreed origins\n\nAccording to one scholar, Richard Strebel, the foundation for modern fighting dogs came from: 1. The Tibetan Mastiff; 2. The English Mastiff, out of which came the French Mastiff, the English Bulldog, and the Pug; 3. The Great Dane, out of which came the Danish Mastiff and the Boxer; 4. The Newfoundland; and 5. The Saint Bernard, out of which came the Leonberger.[8] However, Dieter Fleig disagreed with Strebel and offered the following list as composing of the foundation for modern fighting dogs: 1. The Tibetan Mastiff; 2. The Molossus; 3. The Bull Biter; 4. The Great Dane; 5. The English Mastiff; 6. The Bulldog; 5. The Bull and Terrier; and 6. The Chincha Bulldog.[8]\nThe foundation breed of the fighting dog was, in its outward appearance, a large, low, heavy breed with a powerful build and strongly developed head, and tremendously threatening voice.[8] Additionally, these foundation breeds were also bred for a powerful jaw that would enable them to defend and protect humans, to overpower and pull down large animals on a hunt, and to control large, unmanageable domestic animals.[8] These dogs were also sometimes equipped with metal plates, chains, and collars with sharp spikes or hooked knives in order to be used in wars throughout history.[8]\nWhen bullbaiting became popular in England due to the shortage of bears, bull baiters soon realized that large fighting dogs were built too heavy and too slow for this type of combat.[7] When fighting a bull, dogs were trained to grab onto the bull's nose and pin the bull's head to the ground.[7] If the dog failed to do this, the bull would fling the dog out of the ring with its horns.[7] The British therefore decided to selectively breed fighting dogs for shorter legs and a more powerful jaw.[7] These efforts resulted in the Old English Bulldog.[7]\nHowever, when countries started outlawing bull and bear baiting, dog fighters started pitting dogs against other dogs.[7] With the prevalence of such combat, dogfighters soon realized bulldogs were inadequate and began to breed bulldogs with terriers for more desired characteristics.[7] Terriers were most likely crossbred with bulldogs due to their \"generally rugged body structure,\" speed, aggression, and \"highly developed gameness.\"[7] Yet, there is a debate over which type of terrier was bred with bulldogs in order to create the Bull and Terrier. For instance, Joseph L. Colby claimed that it was the old English White Terrier that the Bull and Terrier is descended from, while Rhonda D. Evans and Craig J. Forsyth contend that its ancestor is the Rat Terrier.[7] Carl Semencic, on the other hand, held that a variety of terriers produced the Bull and Terrier.[7]\nEventually, out of cross breeding bulldogs and terriers, the English created the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.[3] When the Staffordshire Bull Terrier came to America in 1817, Americans began to selectively breed for gameness and created the American Pit Bull Terrier (originally known as the Pit Bull Terrier), which is a unique breed due to its absence of threat displays when fighting and its docility towards humans.[7] Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, and Bull Terriers are all breeds that are commonly labeled as pit bulls.[10] The fact that \"pit bulls\" were historically bred to fight bulls and bears has been used as justifications in some U.S. cities to implement Breed Specific Legislation.[11]\nSocietal aspects\nAfter interviewing 31 dogmen and attending 14 dog fights in the Southern United States, Evans, Gauthier, and Forsyth theorized on what attracts men to dog fights.[12] In their study, Evans, et al., discussed dog fighting's attractiveness in terms of masculinity and class immobility.[12] In the United States, masculinity embodies the qualities of strength, aggression, competition, and striving for success. By embodying these characteristics, a man can gain honor and status in his society.[12] Yet, working class occupations, unlike middle or upper class occupations, provide limited opportunities to validate this culturally accepted definition of masculinity.[12] So, working class men look for alternative ways to validate their masculinity and obtain honor and status. One way to do this is through dogfighting.[12] This is supported by the Evans, et al. findings: the majority of committed dogmen were mostly drawn from the working class, while the middle and upper classes were barely represented.[12] Men from middle and upper classes have opportunities to express their masculinity through their occupations; dog fighting, therefore, is just a hobby for them while it plays a central role in the lives of working class men.[12] Those from the higher classes are drawn in by the thrill and excitement of the fight.\nAside from enjoyment of the sport and status, people are also drawn to dog fighting for money.[3] In fact, the average dog fight could easily net more money than an armed robbery, or a series of isolated drug transactions.[13]\nBait animals\n\n\"Bait\" animals are animals used to test a dog's fighting instinct; they are often mauled or killed in the process. Many of the training methods involve torturing and killing of other animals.[13] Often \"bait\" animals are stolen pets, puppies, kittens, rabbits, small dogs and even stock (pit bulls acquired by the dogfighting ring which appear to be passive or less dominant).[14] Other sources for bait animals include wild or feral animals, animals obtained from a shelter, or animals obtained from \"free to good home\" ads.[15] The snouts of bait animals are often wrapped with duct tape to prevent them from fighting back and they are used in training sessions to improve a dog's endurance, strength or fighting ability.[16] A bait animal's teeth may also be broken to prevent them from fighting back.[14] If the bait animals are still alive after the training sessions, they are usually given to the dogs as a reward, and the dogs finish killing them.[13]\nTypes of dog fighters\nStreet fighters\nOften associated with gang activity, street fighters fight dogs over insults, turf invasions, or simple taunts like \"my dog can kill your dog.\"[3] These type of fights are often spontaneous; unorganized; conducted for money, drugs, or bragging rights; and occur on street corners, back alleys, and neighborhood playgrounds.[3] Urban street fighters generally have several dogs chained in backyards, often behind privacy fences, or in basements or garages.[2] After a street fight, the dogs are often discovered by police and animal control officers either dead or dying.[3] Due to the spontaneity and secrecy of a street fight, they are very difficult to respond to unless reported immediately.[3]\nHobbyists and professionals often decry the techniques street fighters use to train their dogs.[3] Such techniques include starving, drugging, and physically abusing the dog.[3]\nHobbyists\nHobbyists fight dogs for supplemental income and entertainment purposes.[3] They typically have one or more dogs participating in several organized fights and operate primarily within a specific geographic network.[3] Hobbyists are also acquainted with one another and tend to return to predetermined fight venues repeatedly.[2]\nProfessionals\nProfessional fighters breed generations of skilled \"game dogs\" and take a great pride in their dogs' lineage.[2] These fighters make a tremendous amount of money charging stud fees to breed their champions, in addition to the fees and winnings they collect for fighting them.[2] They also tend to own a large number of dogs\u2014sometimes 50 or more.[3] Professionals also use trade journals, such as Your Friend and Mine, Game Dog Times, The American Warrior, and The Pit Bull Chronicle, to discuss recent fights and to advertise the sale of training equipment and puppies. Some fighters operate on a national or even international level within highly secret networks.[2] When a dog is not successful in a fight, a professional may dispose of it using a variety of techniques such as drowning, strangulation, hanging, gunshot, electrocution or some other method.[3] Sometimes professionals and hobbyists dispose of dogs deemed aggressive to humans to street fighters.[3]\nGang and criminal activities\n\nDog fighting is a felony in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.[2] While dog fighting statutes exist independently of general anti-cruelty statutes and carry stiffer penalties than general state anti-cruelty statutes, a person can be charged under both or can be charged under one, but not the other\u2014depending on the evidence.[2] In addition to felony charges for dog fighting, forty-eight states and the District of Columbia, have provisions within their dogfighting statutes that explicitly prohibit attendance as a spectator at a dogfighting exhibition.[2] Since Montana and Hawaii do not have such provisions, a person can pay an entrance fee to watch a dog-fight in either state and not be convicted under these statutes. Additionally, forty-six states, and the District of Columbia, make possessing, owning or keeping a fighting dog a felony.[2]\nWhile dog fighting was previously seen as isolated animal welfare issues\u2014and therefore rarely enforced, the last decade has produced a growing body of legal and empirical evidence that has revealed a connection between dog-fighting and other crimes within a community, such as organized crime, racketeering, drug distribution, and\/or gangs.[2] Within the gang community, fighting dogs compete with firearms as the weapon of choice; indeed, their versatile utility arguably surpasses that of a loaded firearm in the criminal underground. Drug dealers distribute their illicit merchandise, wagers are made, weapons are concealed, and the dogs mutilate each other in a bloody frenzy as crowds cheer on.[2] Violence often erupts among the usually armed gamblers when debts are to be collected and paid.[2] There is also a concern for children who are routinely exposed to dogfighting and are forced to accept the inherent violence as normal.[2] The routine exposure of the children to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance.[2]\nAnimal welfare and rights\nAnimal advocates consider dog fighting to be one of the most serious forms of animal abuse, not only for the violence that the dogs endure during and after the fights, but because of the suffering they often endure in training, which ultimately can lead to death.\nAccording to a filing in U.S. District Court in Richmond by federal investigators in Virginia, which was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and published by the Baltimore Sun on July 6, 2007, a losing dog or one whose potential is considered unacceptable faces \"being put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method\".[17]\nSome of the training of fighting dogs may entail the use of small animals (including kittens) as prey for the dogs.\nStatus by region\nDog fighting has been popular in many countries throughout history and continues to be practiced both legally and illegally around the world.\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, dog fighting has increasingly become an unlawful activity in most jurisdictions of the world, despite in cultural practice it may be common.\nAfrica\nMorocco\nDog fighting is now illegal in Morocco, with dogs previously being imported from France on the black market.[18]\nSouth Africa\nDog fighting has been declared illegal in the Republic of South Africa. However, it is still very popular in the underground world, with dog fighting being a highly syndicated and organized crime. The NSPCA (National Council of SPCAs) is the largest animal welfare organization in Africa, and has been the organization that has conducted the most raids and busts, of which the most recent was in 2013, where 18 people were arrested, and 14 dogs were involved. Dog fighting is mostly practiced in the Western Cape, in the townships area where gangs and drugs are mostly associated with dog fighting.\nDog fighting has been well documented in South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region of Stellenbosch. The Stellenbosch Animal Welfare Society (AWS) frequently responds to complaints of night-time dog fighting in the town of Cloetesville in which hundreds of dogs fight. Young children may be used to transport fighting dogs to avoid arrest of the owners.[19][20]\nAsia\nAfghanistan\nPreviously banned by the Taliban during their rule, dog fighting has made a resurgence throughout Afghanistan as a common winter weekend pastime.\nEspecially in Kabul, where the fights are public and often policed to maintain safety to the spectators. Dogs are not fought to the death, but to submission. Top dogs are worth as much as a new car.[21]\nChina\nDog fighting is allowed under Chinese law, although gambling remains illegal.[22]\nIndia\nDog fighting is extremely rare, but it can be found in some very small parts of Eastern India. The practice is illegal as defined by Indian law.\nJapan\nAccording to historical documents, H\u014dj\u014d Takatoki, the 14th shikken (sh\u014dgun's regent) of the Kamakura shogunate was known to be obsessed with dog fighting, to the point where he allowed his samurai to pay taxes with dogs. During this period dog fighting was known as inuawase(\u72ac\u5408\u308f\u305b).\nDog fighting was considered a way for the Samurai to retain their aggressive edge during peaceful times. Several daimy\u014ds (feudal lords), such as Ch\u014dsokabe Motochika and Yamauchi Y\u014dd\u014d, both from Tosa Province (present-day K\u014dchi Prefecture), were known to encourage dog fighting. Dog fighting was also popular in Akita Prefecture, which is the origin of the Akita breed.\nDog fighting evolved in K\u014dchi to a form that is called t\u014dken(\u95d8\u72ac). Under modern rules, dogs fight in a fenced ring until one of the dogs barks, yelps, or loses the will to fight. Owners are allowed to throw in the towel, and matches are stopped if a doctor judges if is too dangerous. Draws usually occur when both dogs will not fight or both dogs fight until the time limit. There are various other rules, including one that specifies that a dog will lose if it attempts to copulate. Champion dogs are called yokozuna, as in sumo. Dog fighting is not banned at a nationwide level, but the prefectures of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Fukui, Ishikawa, Toyama and Hokkaid\u014d all ban the practice.[23] Currently, most fighting dogs in Japan are of the Tosa breed which is native to K\u014dchi.[24]\nPakistan\nDog fighting and other forms of animal fighting are extremely popular in all parts of rural Pakistan, and is deeply rooted in the rural culture, where some 70 percent of the population resides. It has been a way for tribes, clans and the rural people to socialize while being entertained.[25]\nEven though it has recently been banned by law, it is still being practiced in rural Pakistan, especially in provinces such as Punjab, Azad Kashmir, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. Now Karachi.Sindhi is the most popular city about Pitbull fighting with the proper rules There can apparently be as much as millions of rupees at stake for the owners of winning dogs,[26] so different breeds have carefully been bred and selected specifically for the purpose, such as the Bully Kutta.\nPhilippines\nDog fighting is illegal in the Philippines, with those involved being convicted under animal cruelty laws.[27]\nAustralia\nDog fighting and the possession of any fighting equipment designed for dog fighting is illegal in all Australian states and territories.[28] The illegal nature of dogfighting in Australia means that injured dogs rarely get veterinary treatment placing the dog's health and welfare at even greater risk.[28] \"Restricted Breed Dogs\" cannot be imported into Australia. These include the Dogo Argentino, the Japanese Tosa, the Fila Brasileiro, the Perro de Presa Canario and the American Pit Bull Terrier. Of these, the Pit Bull Terrier and the Perro de Presa Canario are the only breeds currently known to exist in Australia and there are strict regulations on keeping these breeds, including a prohibition on transferring ownership.[29]\nEurope\nIreland\nDog fighting has been illegal in Ireland for over 150 years, although the sport is still popular in underground circles.[30]\nRussia\nAlthough animal cruelty laws exist in Russia, dog fighting is widely practiced. Laws prohibiting dogfights have been passed in certain places like Moscow by order of that city's mayor. In much of Russia dogfights are legally held generally using Caucasian Shepherd Dog, Georgian shepherd, Central Asian Shepherd Dog. Temperament tests, which are a common and relatively mild form of dog fighting used for breeding purposes, are fairly commonplace. Most dog fights are traditional contests used to test the stamina and ability of working dogs used to protect livestock. Unlike fights with pit bulls and other fighting breeds, a veterinarian is always on hand and the contests are never to the death, and serious injuries are very rare. Most fights are over in minutes when its clear which dog is superior. At the end of three rounds the contest is declared a draw.[31]\nUnited Kingdom\nDog fighting remains illegal under UK law.[32] Despite periodic dog-fight prosecutions, however, illegal canine pit battles continued after the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 of England and Wales.[33] The Protection of Animals Act 1911 was specific in outlawing \"the fighting or baiting of animals\", however the sport remains popular in underground circles.[34]\nSporting journals of the 18th and 19th centuries depict the Black Country and London as the primary English dog fight centres of the period.[35]\nNew Zealand\nIn accordance with the Animal Welfare Act 1999, dog fighting is illegal within New Zealand. Breeding, training or owning dogs for fighting is also illegal.[36]\nNorth America\n\nDog fighting has been illegal in Canada since 1892; however, the current law requires police to catch individuals during the unlawful act, which is often difficult.[37]\nDog fighting is a felony in all 50 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.[2]  In most of the United States a spectator at a dog fight can be charged with a felony while some areas only consider it a misdemeanor offense.\nIn addition, the federal U.S. Animal Welfare Act makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sell, buy, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any dog for purposes of having the dog participate in an animal fighting venture. The act also makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly use the mail service of the United States Postal Service or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for commercial speech for purposes of advertising a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, promoting or in any other manner furthering an animal fighting venture except as performed outside the limits of the States of the United States.[38]\nIn the second largest dog fighting raid in U.S. history in August 2013, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama handed down the longest prison term ever handed down in a federal dog fighting case: eight years.[39]\nAccording to a study by the College of Law of Michigan State University published in 2005, in the United States, dog fighting was once completely legal and was sanctioned and promoted during the colonial period through the Victorian and well into the 20th century. In the second half 19th century dog fighting started to be criminalized in the United States.\nThere is a US$5,000 reward for reporting dog fighting to The Humane Society of the United States[40] From the HSUS: How to spot signs of dogfighting in your community: An inordinate number of pit bull-type dogs being kept in one location, especially multiple dogs who are chained and seem unsocialized; Dogs with scars on their faces, front legs, and stifle area (hind end and thighs); Dogfighting training equipment such as \"breaking sticks\" or \"break sticks\" used to pry apart the jaws of dogs locked in battle which are foot long, flat on one side, appearing to be sharpened; tires or \"spring poles\" (usually a large spring with rope attached to either end) hanging from tree limbs; or unusual foot traffic coming and going from a location at odd hours.\nCNN estimated that in the United States more than 100,000 people are engaged in dog fighting on a non-professional basis and roughly 40,000 individuals are involved as professionals in the sport of dog fighting as a commercial activity. Top fights are said to have purses of $100,000 or more.[41]\nIn Costa Rica, dogfights were illegal for decades as a misdemeanor, since 2014 and after a legal reform became a felony and is punished with up to three years of imprisonment.[42][43]\nSouth America\nDog fighting is illegal in much of South America. The American Pit Bull Terrier is by far the most common breed involved in the bloodsport. The Dogo Argentino was also used as fighting dog. The Dogo Cubano and Cordoba Fighting Dog were used for fighting a century ago, but have become extinct.\nDog Fighting terms\nCur - Cowardly dog[44][45]\nGamesness - willingness to fight[46]\nRollin - Practice fight\nSee also\nCockfight\nCricket fighting\nList of dog fighting breeds\nSpider fighting\n\n\n\n\nGeneral information\n\nNews articles\nCite uses deprecated parameter |dead-url= (help)\nCite uses deprecated parameter |dead-url= (help)\nCite uses deprecated parameter |deadurl= (help)\nCite uses deprecated parameter |deadurl= (help)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"eedd52d2-c247-47a3-aaf5-b7973e0e45d9"}
{"question":"What is the surface area of the human cortex?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[2856,2146,2146],"passage_indices":[6,5,5],"start_positions":[2847,2131,2131],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","NONE","NONE"]},"context":["\n\nThe cerebral cortex is the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain, in humans and other mammals. It is separated into two cortices, by the longitudinal fissure that divides the cerebrum into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The two hemispheres are joined beneath the cortex by the corpus callosum. The cerebral cortex is the largest site of neural integration in the central nervous system.[1] It plays a key role in memory, attention, perception, awareness, thought, language, and consciousness.\nIn large mammals, the cerebral cortex is folded, providing a greater surface area in the confined volume of the cranium. Apart from minimising brain and cranial volume cortical folding is crucial for the wiring of the brain and its functional organisation. In mammals with a small brain there is no folding and the cortex is smooth.[2][3]\nA fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus (plural gyri) and a groove is termed a sulcus (plural sulci). These surface convolutions appear during fetal development and continue to mature after birth through the process of gyrification. In the human brain the majority of the cerebral cortex is not visible from the outside, but buried in the sulci.[4]\nThere are between 14 and 16 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex. These are organised into  cortical columns and minicolumns of neurons that make up the layers of the cortex. Most of the cerebral cortex consists of the six-layered neocortex. Cortical areas have specific functions.\nStructure\nThe cerebral cortex is the outer covering of the surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres and is folded into peaks called gyri, and grooves called sulci. It is between two and three millimetres thick.[1] It makes up 40 per cent of the brain's mass. There are between 14 and 16 billion neurons in the cortex,[1] and these are organized in cortical columns, and minicolumns of the layers of the cortex.  \nFolds\n\nThe cerebral cortex is folded in a way that allows a large surface area of neural tissue to fit within the confines of the neurocranium. When unfolded, each hemispheric cortex has a total surface area of about 1.3 square feet (0.12m2).[5] The folding is inward away from the surface of the brain, and is also present on the medial surface of each hemisphere within the longitudinal fissure. Most mammals have a cerebral cortex that is convoluted with the peaks known as gyri and the troughs or grooves known as sulci. Some small mammals including some small rodents have smooth cerebral surfaces without gyrification.[3]\nThickness\nFor species of mammals, larger brains (in absolute terms, not just in relation to body size) tend to have thicker cortices.[6] The smallest mammals, such as shrews, have a neocortical thickness of about 0.5mm; the ones with the largest brains, such as humans and fin whales, have thicknesses of 2.3\u20132.8mm. There is an approximately logarithmic relationship between brain weight and cortical thickness.[6]\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain (MRI) makes it possible to get a measure for the thickness of the human cerebral cortex and relate it to other measures. The thickness of different cortical areas varies but in general, sensory cortex is thinner than motor cortex.[7] One study has found some positive association between the cortical thickness and intelligence.[8]\nAnother study has found that the somatosensory cortex is thicker in migraine sufferers, though it is not known if this is the result of migraine attacks or the cause of them.[9][10]\nA later study using a larger patient population reports no change in the cortical thickness in migraine sufferers.[11]\nA genetic disorder of the cerebral cortex, whereby decreased folding in certain areas results in a microgyrus, where there are four layers instead of six, is in some instances seen to be related to dyslexia.[12]\nLayers of neocortex\n\n\n\nThe six cortical layers of the neocortex each contain a characteristic distribution of different neurons and their connections with other cortical and subcortical regions. There are direct connections between different cortical areas and indirect connections via the thalamus. One of the clearest examples of cortical layering is the line of Gennari in the primary visual cortex. This is a band of whiter tissue that can be observed with the naked eye in the fundus of the calcarine sulcus of the occipital lobe. The line of Gennari is composed of axons bringing visual information from the thalamus into layer IV of the visual cortex.\nStaining cross-sections of the cortex to reveal the position of neuronal cell bodies and the intracortical axon tracts allowed neuroanatomists in the early 20th century to produce a detailed description of the laminar structure of the cortex in different species. After the work of Korbinian Brodmann (1909) the neurons of the cerebral cortex are grouped into six main layers, from outside (pial surface) to inside (white matter):\nLayer I\nLayer I is the molecular layer, and contains few scattered neurons, including GABAergic rosehip neurons.[13] Layer I consists largely of extensions of apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal neurons and horizontally oriented axons, as well as glial cells.[14] During development Cajal-Retzius cells[15] and subpial granular layer cells[16] are present in this layer. Also, some spiny stellate cells can be found here. Inputs to the apical tufts are thought to be crucial for the feedback interactions in the cerebral cortex involved in associative learning and attention.[17] While it was once thought that the input to layer I came from the cortex itself,[18] it is now realized that layer I across the cerebral cortex mantle receives substantial input from matrix or M-type thalamus cells[19] (in contrast to core or C-type that go to layer IV).[20]\nLayer II\nLayer II, the external granular layer, contains small pyramidal neurons and numerous stellate neurons.\nLayer III\nLayer III, the external pyramidal layer, contains predominantly small and medium-size pyramidal neurons, as well as non-pyramidal neurons with vertically oriented intracortical axons; layers I through III are the main target of interhemispheric corticocortical afferents, and layer III is the principal source of corticocortical efferents.\nLayer IV\nLayer IV, the internal granular layer, contains different types of stellate and pyramidal cells, and is the main target of thalamocortical afferents from thalamus type C neurons (core-type )[20] as well as intra-hemispheric corticocortical afferents. The layers above layer IV are also referred to as supragranular layers (layers I-III), whereas the layers below are referred to as infragranular layers (layers V and VI).\nLayer V\nLayer V, the internal pyramidal layer, contains large pyramidal neurons. Axons from these leave the cortex and connect with subcortical structures including the basal ganglia. In the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe, layer V contains giant pyramidal cells called Betz cells, whose axons travel through the internal capsule, the brain stem, and the spinal cord forming the corticospinal tract, which is the main pathway for voluntary motor control.\nLayer VI\nLayer VI, the polymorphic or multiform layer, contains few large pyramidal neurons and many small spindle-like pyramidal and multiform neurons; layer VI sends efferent fibers to the thalamus, establishing a very precise reciprocal interconnection between the cortex and the thalamus.[21] That is, layer VI neurons from one cortical column connect with thalamus neurons that provide input to the same cortical column. These connections are both excitatory and inhibitory. Neurons send excitatory fibers to neurons in the thalamus and also send collaterals to the thalamic reticular nucleus that inhibit these same thalamus neurons or ones adjacent to them.[22] One theory is that because the inhibitory output is reduced by cholinergic input to the cerebral cortex, this provides the brainstem with adjustable \"gain control for the relay of lemniscal inputs\".[22]\nColumns\nThe cortical layers are not simply stacked one over the other; there exist characteristic connections between different layers and neuronal types, which span all the thickness of the cortex. These cortical microcircuits are grouped into cortical columns and minicolumns. It has been proposed that the minicolumns are the basic functional units of the cortex.[23] In 1957, Vernon Mountcastle showed that the functional properties of the cortex change abruptly between laterally adjacent points; however, they are continuous in the direction perpendicular to the surface. Later works have provided evidence of the presence of functionally distinct cortical columns in the visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959),[24] auditory cortex,\nand associative cortex.\nCortical areas that lack a layer IV are called agranular. Cortical areas that have only a rudimentary layer IV are called dysgranular.[25] Information processing within each layer is determined by different temporal dynamics with that in the layers II\/III having a slow 2Hz oscillation while that in layer V having a fast 10\u201315Hz one.[26]\nTypes of cortex\n\n\n\nBased on the differences in laminar organization the cerebral cortex can be classified into two types, the large area of neocortex which has six cell layers, and the much smaller area of allocortex that has three or four layers:\nThe neocortex is also known as the isocortex or neopallium and is the part of the mature cerebral cortex with six distinct layers. Examples of neocortical areas include the granular primary motor cortex, and the striate primary visual cortex. The neocortex has two subtypes, the true isocortex and the proisocortex which is a transitional region between the isocortex and the regions of the periallocortex.\nThe allocortex is the part of the cerebral cortex with three or four layers, and has three subtypes, the paleocortex with three cortical laminae, the archicortex which has four or five, and a transitional area adjacent to the allocortex, the periallocortex. Examples of allocortex are the olfactory cortex and the hippocampus.\nThere is a transitional area between the neocortex and the allocortex called the paralimbic cortex, where layers 2, 3 and 4 are merged. This area incorporates the proisocortex of the neocortex and the periallocortex of the allocortex. In addition, the cerebral cortex may be classified into four lobes: the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, the parietal lobe, and the occipital lobe, named from their overlying bones of the skull.\nBrodmann areas\n\nDifferent parts of the cerebral cortex are involved in different cognitive and behavioral functions. The differences show up in a number of ways: the effects of localized brain damage, regional activity patterns exposed when the brain is examined using functional imaging techniques, connectivity with subcortical areas, and regional differences in the cellular architecture of the cortex. The neocortex is described as having six layers but not all layers are apparent in all areas, and even when a layer is present, its thickness and cellular organization may vary. Scientists have constructed maps of cortical areas on the basis of variations in the appearance of the layers as seen with a microscope. One of the most widely used schemes came from Korbinian Brodmann, who split the cortex into 51 different areas and assigned each a number (many of these Brodmann areas have since been subdivided). For example, Brodmann area 1 is the primary somatosensory cortex, Brodmann area 17 is the primary visual cortex, and Brodmann area 25 is the anterior cingulate cortex.[27]\nBlood supply and drainage\n\n\n\nBlood supply to the cerebral cortex is part of the cerebral circulation. Cerebral arteries supply the blood that perfuses the cerebrum. This arterial blood carries oxygen, glucose, and other nutrients to the cortex. Cerebral veins drain the deoxygenated blood, and metabolic wastes including carbon dioxide, back to the heart.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe prenatal development of the cerebral cortex is a complex and finely tuned process called corticogenesis, influenced by the interplay between genes and the environment.[28]\nNeural tube\nThe cerebral cortex develops from the most anterior part, the forebrain region, of the neural tube.[29][30] The neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube. From the cavity inside the neural tube develops the ventricular system, and, from the neuroepithelial cells of its walls, the neurons and glia of the nervous system. The most anterior (front, or cranial) part of the neural plate, the prosencephalon, which is evident before neurulation begins, gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres and later cortex.[31]\nCortical neuron development\n\nCortical neurons are generated within the ventricular zone, next to the ventricles. At first, this zone contains neural stem cells, that transition to radial glial cells\u2013progenitor cells, which divide to produce glial cells and neurons.[32]\nRadial glia\n\nThe cerebral cortex is composed of a heterogenous population of cells that give rise to different cell types. The majority of these cells are derived from radial glia migration that form the different cell types of the neocortex and it is a period associated with an increase in neurogenesis. Similarly, the process of neurogenesis regulates lamination to form the different layers of the cortex. During this process there is an increase in the restriction of cell fate that begins with earlier progenitors giving rise to any cell type in the cortex and later progenitors giving rise only to neurons of superficial layers. This differential cell fate creates an inside-out topography in the cortex with younger neurons in superficial layers and older neurons in deeper layers. In addition, laminar neurons are stopped in S or G2 phase in order to give a fine distinction between the different cortical layers. Laminar differentiation is not fully complete until after birth since during development laminar neurons are still sensitive to extrinsic signals and environmental cues.[33]\nAlthough the majority of the cells that compose the cortex are derived locally from radial glia there is a subset population of neurons that migrate from other regions. Radial glia give rise to neurons that are pyramidal in shape and use glutamate as a neurotransmitter, however these migrating cells contribute neurons that are stellate-shaped and use GABA as their main neurotransmitter. These GABAergic neurons are generated by progenitor cells in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) that migrate tangentially to the cortex via the subventricular zone. This migration of GABAergic neurons is particularly important since GABA receptors are excitatory during development. This excitation is primarily driven by the flux of chloride ions through the GABA receptor, however in adults chloride concentrations shift causing an inward flux of chloride that hyperpolarizes postsynaptic neurons.[34]\nThe glial fibers produced in the first divisions of the progenitor cells are radially oriented, spanning the thickness of the cortex from the ventricular zone to the outer, pial surface, and provide scaffolding for the migration of neurons outwards from the ventricular zone.[35][36]\nAt birth there are very few dendrites present on the cortical neuron's cell body, and the axon is undeveloped. During the first year of life the dendrites become dramatically increased in number, such that they can accommodate up to a hundred thousand synaptic connections with other neurons. The axon can develop to extend a long way from the cell body.[37]\nAsymmetric division\nThe first divisions of the progenitor cells are symmetric, which duplicates the total number of progenitor cells at each mitotic cycle. Then, some progenitor cells begin to divide asymmetrically, producing one postmitotic cell that migrates along the radial glial fibers, leaving the ventricular zone, and one progenitor cell, which continues to divide until the end of development, when it differentiates into a glial cell or an ependymal cell. As the G1 phase of mitosis is elongated, in what is seen as selective cell-cycle lengthening, the newly-born neurons migrate to more superficial layers of the cortex.[38] The migrating daughter cells become the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex.[39] The development process is time ordered and regulated by hundreds of genes and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.[40]\nLayer organisation\nThe layered structure of the mature cerebral cortex is formed during development. The first pyramidal neurons generated migrate out of the ventricular zone and subventricular zone, together with reelin-producing Cajal\u2013Retzius neurons, from the preplate. Next, a cohort of neurons migrating into the middle of the preplate divides this transient layer into the superficial marginal zone, which will become layer I of the mature neocortex, and the subplate,[41] forming a middle layer called the cortical plate. These cells will form the deep layers of the mature cortex, layers five and six. Later born neurons migrate radially into the cortical plate past the deep layer neurons, and become the upper layers (two to four). Thus, the layers of the cortex are created in an inside-out order.[42] The only exception to this inside-out sequence of neurogenesis occurs in the layer I of primates, in which, in contrast to rodents, neurogenesis continues throughout the entire period of corticogenesis.[43]\nCortical patterning\n\nThe map of functional cortical areas, which include primary motor and visual cortex, originates from a 'protomap',[44] which is regulated by molecular signals such as fibroblast growth factor FGF8 early in embryonic development.[45][46] These signals regulate the size, shape, and position of cortical areas on the surface of the cortical primordium, in part by regulating gradients of transcription factor expression, through a process called cortical patterning. Examples of such transcription factors include the genes EMX2 and PAX6.[47] Together, both transcription factors form an opposing gradient of expression. Pax6 is highly expressed at the rostral lateral pole, while Emx2 is highly expressed in the caudomedial pole. The establishment of this gradient is important for proper development. For example, mutations in Pax6 can cause expression levels of Emx2 to expand out of its normal expression domain, which would ultimately lead to an expansion of the areas normally derived from the caudal medial cortex, such as the visual cortex. On the contrary, if mutations in Emx2 occur, it can cause the Pax6-expressing domain to expand and result in the frontal and motor cortical regions enlarging. Therefore, researchers believe that similar gradients and signaling centers next to the cortex could contribute to the regional expression of these transcription factors.[34]\nTwo very well studied patterning signals for the cortex include FGF and retinoic acid. If FGFs are misexpressed in different areas of the developing cortex, cortical patterning is disrupted. Specifically, when Fgf8 is increased in the anterior pole, Emx2 is downregulated and a caudal shift in the cortical region occurs. This ultimately causes an expansion of the rostral regions. Therefore, Fgf8 and other FGFs play a role in the regulation of expression of Emx2 and Pax6 and represent how the cerebral cortex can become specialized for different functions.[34]\nRapid expansion of the cortical surface area is regulated by the amount of self-renewal of radial glial cells and is partly regulated by FGF and Notch genes.[48] During the period of cortical neurogenesis and layer formation, many higher mammals begin the process of gyrification, which generates the characteristic folds of the cerebral cortex.[49][50] Gyrification is regulated by a DNA-associated protein Trnp1[51] and by FGF and SHH signaling[52][53]\nEvolution\nOf all the different brain regions, the cerebral cortex shows the largest evolutionary variation and has evolved most recently.[3] In contrast to the highly conserved circuitry of the medulla oblongata, for example, which serves critical functions such as regulation of heart and respiration rates, many areas of the cerebral cortex are not strictly necessary for survival. Thus, the evolution of the cerebral cortex has seen the advent and modification of new functional areas\u2014particularly association areas that do not directly receive input from outside the cortex.[3]\nA key theory of cortical evolution is embodied in the radial unit hypothesis and related protomap hypothesis, first proposed by Rakic.[54] This theory states that new cortical areas are formed by the addition of new radial units, which is accomplished at the stem cell level. The protomap hypothesis states that the cellular and molecular identity and characteristics of neurons in each cortical area are specified by cortical stem cells, known as radial glial cells, in a primordial map. This map is controlled by secreted signaling proteins and downstream transcription factors.[55][56][57]\nFunction\n\nConnections\nThe cerebral cortex is connected to various subcortical structures such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia, sending information to them along efferent connections and receiving information from them via afferent connections. Most sensory information is routed to the cerebral cortex via the thalamus. Olfactory information, however, passes through the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex (piriform cortex). The majority of connections are from one area of the cortex to another, rather than from subcortical areas; Braitenberg and Sch\u00fcz (1998) claim that in primary sensory areas, at the cortical level where the input fibres terminate, up to 20% of the synapses are supplied by extracortical afferents but that in other areas and other layers the percentage is likely to be much lower.[58]\nCortical areas\n\n\nThe cortex is commonly described as comprising three parts: sensory, motor, and association areas.\nSensory areas\nThe sensory areas are the cortical areas that receive and process information from the senses. Parts of the cortex that receive sensory inputs from the thalamus are called primary sensory areas. The senses of vision, audition, and touch are served by the primary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex and primary somatosensory cortex respectively. In general, the two hemispheres receive information from the opposite (contralateral) side of the body. For example, the right primary somatosensory cortex receives information from the left limbs, and the right visual cortex receives information from the left visual field. The organization of sensory maps in the cortex reflects that of the corresponding sensing organ, in what is known as a topographic map. Neighboring points in the primary visual cortex, for example, correspond to neighboring points in the retina. This topographic map is called a retinotopic map. In the same way, there exists a tonotopic map in the primary auditory cortex and a somatotopic map in the primary sensory cortex. This last topographic map of the body onto the posterior central gyrus has been illustrated as a deformed human representation, the somatosensory homunculus, where the size of different body parts reflects the relative density of their innervation. Areas with lots of sensory innervation, such as the fingertips and the lips, require more cortical area to process finer sensation.\nMotor areas\nThe motor areas are located in both hemispheres of the cortex. They are shaped like a pair of headphones stretching from ear to ear. The motor areas are very closely related to the control of voluntary movements, especially fine fragmented movements performed by the hand. The right half of the motor area controls the left side of the body, and vice versa.\nTwo areas of the cortex are commonly referred to as motor:\nPrimary motor cortex, which executes voluntary movements \nSupplementary motor areas and premotor cortex, which select voluntary movements. \nIn addition, motor functions have been described for:\nPosterior parietal cortex, which guides voluntary movements in space\nDorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which decides which voluntary movements to make according to higher-order instructions, rules, and self-generated thoughts.\nJust underneath the cerebral cortex are interconnected subcortical masses of grey matter called basal ganglia (or nuclei). The basal ganglia receive input from the substantia nigra of the midbrain and motor areas of the cerebral cortex, and send signals back to both of these locations. They are involved in motor control. They are found lateral to the thalamus. The main components of the basal ganglia are the caudate nucleus, the putamen, the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra, the nucleus accumbens, and the subthalamic nucleus. The putamen and globus pallidus are also collectively known as the lentiform nucleus, because together they form a lens-shaped body. The putamen and caudate nucleus are also collectively called the corpus striatum after their striped appearance.[59][60]\nAssociation areas\nThe association areas are the parts of the cerebral cortex that do not belong to the primary regions. They function to produce a meaningful perceptual experience of the world, enable us to interact effectively, and support abstract thinking and language. The parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes - all located in the posterior part of the cortex - integrate sensory information and information stored in memory. The frontal lobe or prefrontal association complex is involved in planning actions and movement, as well as abstract thought. Globally, the association areas are organized as distributed networks.[61] Each network connects areas distributed across widely spaced regions of the cortex. Distinct networks are positioned adjacent to one another yielding a complex series of interwoven networks. The specific organization of the association networks is debated with evidence for interactions, hierarchical relationships, and competition between networks.[62]\n\nIn humans, association networks are particularly important to language function. In the past it was theorized that language abilities are localized in Broca's area in areas of the left  inferior frontal gyrus, BA44 and BA45,  for language expression and in Wernicke's area BA22, for language reception. However, the processes of language expression and reception have been shown to occur in areas other than just those structures around the lateral sulcus, including the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and pons.[63]\nClinical significance\n\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Lafora disease, show as a marker, an atrophy of the grey matter of the cerebral cortex.[64]\nThe cerebral cortex can be adversely affected by a wide range of genetic disorders, and chromosome abnormalities some of which may be acquired. These can result in neurodevelopmental disorders such as fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome.\nOther diseases of the central nervous system include neurological disorders such as epilepsy, movement disorders, and difficulties in speech (aphasia).\nBrain damage from disease or trauma, can involve damage to a specific lobe such as in frontal lobe disorder, and associated functions will be affected. The blood-brain barrier \nthat serves to protect the brain from infection can become compromised allowing entry to pathogens.\nThe developing fetus is susceptible to a range of environmental factors that can cause birth defects and problems in later development. Maternal alcohol consumption for example can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.[65] Other factors that can cause neurodevelopment disorders are  toxicants such as drugs, and exposure to radiation as from X-rays.\nA disorder of neuronal migration is lissencephaly a condition in which the cerebral surface is smooth without \nthe convulutions of gyrification.\nA type of electrocorticography called cortical stimulation mapping is an invasive procedure that involves placing electrodes directly onto the exposed brain in order to localise the functions of specific areas of the cortex. It is used in clinical and therapeutic applications including pre-surgical mapping.[66]\nOther animals\nThe cerebral cortex is derived from the pallium, a layered structure found in the forebrain of all vertebrates. The basic form of the pallium is a cylindrical layer enclosing fluid-filled ventricles. Around the circumference of the cylinder are four zones, the dorsal pallium, medial pallium, ventral pallium, and lateral pallium, which are thought respectively to give rise to the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and olfactory cortex.\nUntil recently no counterpart to the cerebral cortex had been recognized in invertebrates. However, a study published in the journal Cell in 2010, based on gene expression profiles, reported strong affinities between the cerebral cortex and the mushroom bodies of the ragworm Platynereis dumerilii.[67] Mushroom bodies are structures in the brains of many types of worms and arthropods that are known to play important roles in learning and memory; the genetic evidence indicates a common evolutionary origin, and therefore indicates that the origins of the earliest precursors of the cerebral cortex date back to the early Precambrian era.\nAdditional images\n\nMotor and sensory regions of the cerebral cortex\nMotor and sensory regions of the cerebral cortex\n\nSee also\n\n\nBrain-computer interface\nCortical dysplasia\nCortical homunculus\nEloquent cortex\nEMX1\nGray matter heterotopia\nLimbic system\nList of regions in the human brain\n\n\n\n\n at NeuroNames\n at the BrainMaps project\n, Webvision: Comprehensive article about the structure and function of the primary visual cortex.\n, Webvision: Image of the basic cell types of the monkey cerebral cortex.\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"fc18af17-6bd1-44c2-ab5e-f71eb09c447a"}

A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate power and to what ends it should be used. Some political parties follow a certain ideology very closely while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. The popularity of an ideology is in part due to the influence of moral entrepreneurs, who sometimes act in their own interests. Political ideologies have two dimensions: (1) goals: how society should be organized; and (2) methods: the most appropriate way to achieve this goal.\nAn ideology is a collection of ideas. Typically, each ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers to be the best form of government (e.g. democracy or autocracy) and the best economic system (e.g. capitalism or socialism). The same word is sometimes used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, socialism may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology which supports that economic system. The same term may also be used to refer to multiple ideologies and that is why political scientists try to find consensus definitions for these terms. For instance, while the terms have been conflated at times communism has come in common parlance and in academics to refer to Soviet-type regimes and Marxist\u2013Leninist ideologies whereas socialism has come to refer to a wider range of differing ideologies distinct from Marxism\u2013Leninism. [1] Political ideology is a term fraught with problems, having been called \"the most elusive concept in the whole of social science\".[2] However, ideologies tend to identify themselves by their position on the political spectrum (such as the left, the centre or the right), though this is very often controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from political strategies (e.g. populism as it is commonly defined) and from single issues around which a party may be built (e.g. opposition to European integration or the legalization of marijuana), although either of these may be central to a particular ideology. There are several studies that show that political ideology is heritable within families.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]\nThe following list is strictly alphabetical and attempts to divide the ideologies found in practical political life into a number of groups and each group contains ideologies that are related to each other. The headers refer to names of the best-known ideologies in each group. The names of the headers do not necessarily imply some hierarchical order or that one ideology evolved out of the other. They are merely noting that the ideologies in question are practically, historically and ideologically related to each other. One ideology can belong to several groups and there is sometimes considerable overlap between related ideologies. The meaning of a political label can also differ between countries and political parties often subscribe to a combination of ideologies.\nAnarchism\n\n\nPolitical internationals\nAnarkismo

{"question":"Who was the best artist during the Classical period?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1,25269,-1],"passage_indices":[-1,42,-1],"start_positions":[-1,25262,-1],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","NONE","NONE"]},"context":["\n\n\nAncient Greek art stands out among that of other ancient cultures for its development of naturalistic but idealized depictions of the human body, in which largely nude male figures were generally the focus of innovation. The rate of stylistic development between about 750 and 300 BC was remarkable by ancient standards, and in surviving works is best seen in sculpture. There were important innovations in painting, which have to be essentially reconstructed due to the lack of original survivals of quality, other than the distinct field of painted pottery. \nGreek architecture, technically very simple, established a harmonious style with numerous detailed conventions that were largely adopted by Roman architecture and are still followed in some modern buildings.  It used a vocabulary of ornament that was shared with pottery, metalwork and other media, and had an enormous influence on Eurasian art, especially after Buddhism carried it beyond the expanded Greek world created by Alexander the Great.  The social context of Greek art included radical political developments and a great increase in prosperity; the equally impressive Greek achievements in philosophy, literature and other fields are well known.\nThe earliest art by Greeks is generally excluded from \"ancient Greek art\", and instead known as Aegean art; this includes Cycladic art and the art of the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures from the Greek Bronze Age.[1]  The art of ancient Greece is usually divided stylistically into four periods: the Geometric, Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic.  The Geometric age is usually dated from about 1000 BC, although in reality little is known about art in Greece during the preceding 200 years, traditionally known as the Greek Dark Ages.  The 7th century BC witnessed the slow development of the Archaic style as exemplified by the black-figure style of vase painting. Around 500 BC, shortly before the onset of the Persian Wars (480 BC to 448 BC), is usually taken as the dividing line between the Archaic and the Classical periods, and the reign of Alexander the Great (336 BC to 323 BC) is taken as separating the Classical from the Hellenistic periods.  From some point in the 1st century BC onwards \"Greco-Roman\" is used, or more local terms for the Eastern Greek world.[2]\nIn reality, there was no sharp transition from one period to another. Forms of art developed at different speeds in different parts of the Greek world, and as in any age some artists worked in more innovative styles than others. Strong local traditions, and the requirements of local cults, enable historians to locate the origins even of works of art found far from their place of origin.  Greek art of various kinds was widely exported.  The whole period saw a generally steady increase in prosperity and trading links within the Greek world and with neighbouring cultures.\nThe survival rate of Greek art differs starkly between media. We have huge quantities of pottery and coins, much stone sculpture, though even more Roman copies, and a few large bronze sculptures. Almost entirely missing are painting, fine metal vessels, and anything in perishable materials including wood.  The stone shell of a number of temples and theatres has survived, but little of their extensive decoration.[3]\nPottery\n\n\n\n\n\nBy convention, finely painted vessels of all shapes are called \"vases\", and there are over 100,000 significantly complete surviving pieces,[6] giving (with the inscriptions that many carry) unparalleled insights into many aspects of Greek life. Sculptural or architectural pottery, also very often painted, are referred to as terracottas, and also survive in large quantities.  In much of the literature, \"pottery\" means only painted vessels, or \"vases\".  Pottery was the main form of grave goods deposited in tombs, often as \"funerary urns\" containing the cremated ashes, and was widely exported.\nThe famous and distinctive style of Greek vase-painting with figures depicted with strong outlines, with thin lines within the outlines, reached its peak from about 600 to 350 BC, and divides into the two main styles, almost reversals of each other, of black-figure and red-figure painting, the other colour forming the background in each case.  Other colours were very limited, normally to small areas of white and larger ones of a different purplish-red.  Within the restrictions of these techniques and other strong conventions, vase-painters achieved remarkable results, combining refinement and powerful expression. White ground technique allowed more freedom in depiction, but did not wear well and was mostly made for burial.[7]\nConventionally, the ancient Greeks are said to have made most pottery vessels for everyday use, not for display.  Exceptions are the large Archaic monumental vases made as grave-markers, trophies won at games, such as the Panathenaic Amphorae filled with olive oil, and pieces made specifically to be left in graves; some perfume bottles have a money-saving bottom just below the mouth, so a small quantity makes them appear full.[8]  In recent decades many scholars have questioned this, seeing much more production than was formerly thought as made to be placed in graves, as a cheaper substitute for metalware in both Greece and Etruria.[9]\nMost surviving pottery consists of vessels for storing, serving or drinking liquids such as amphorae, kraters (bowls for mixing wine and water), hydria (water jars), libation bowls, oil and perfume bottles for the toilet, jugs and cups. Painted vessels for serving and eating food are much less common.  Painted pottery was affordable even by ordinary people, and a piece \"decently decorated with about five or six figures cost about two or three days' wages\".[10]   Miniatures were also produced in large numbers, mainly for use as offerings at temples.[11] In the Hellenistic period a wider range of pottery was produced, but most of it is of little artistic importance.\nIn earlier periods even quite small Greek cities produced pottery for their own locale.  These varied widely in style and standards. Distinctive pottery that ranks as art was produced on some of the Aegean islands, in Crete, and in the wealthy Greek colonies of southern Italy and Sicily.[12] By the later Archaic and early Classical period, however, the two great commercial powers, Corinth and Athens, came to dominate.  Their pottery was exported all over the Greek world, driving out the local varieties. Pots from Corinth and Athens are found as far afield as Spain and Ukraine, and are so common in Italy that they were first collected in the 18th century as \"Etruscan vases\".[13]  Many of these pots are mass-produced products of low quality. In fact, by the 5th century BC, pottery had become an industry and pottery painting ceased to be an important art form.\nThe range of colours which could be used on pots was restricted by the technology of firing: black, white, red, and yellow were the most common. In the three earlier periods, the pots were left their natural light colour, and were decorated with slip that turned black in the kiln.[7]\nGreek pottery is frequently signed, sometimes by the potter or the master of the pottery, but only occasionally by the painter. Hundreds of painters are, however, identifiable by their artistic personalities: where their signatures have not survived they are named for their subject choices, as \"the Achilles Painter\",  by the potter they worked for, such as the Late Archaic \"Kleophrades Painter\", or even by their modern locations, such as the Late Archaic \"Berlin Painter\".[14]\nHistory\nThe history of ancient Greek pottery is divided stylistically into five periods:\nthe Protogeometric from about 1050 BC\nthe Geometric from about 900 BC\nthe Late Geometric or Archaic from about 750 BC\nthe Black Figure from the early 7th century BC\nand the Red Figure from about 530 BC\nDuring the Protogeometric and Geometric periods, Greek pottery was decorated with abstract designs, in the former usually elegant and large, with plenty of unpainted space, but in the Geometric often densely covering most of the surface, as in the large pots by the Dipylon Master, who worked around 750.  He and other potters around his time began to introduce very stylised silhouette figures of humans and animals, especially horses. These often represent funeral processions, or battles, presumably representing those fought by the deceased.[15]\nThe Geometric phase was followed by an Orientalizing period in the late 8th century, when a few animals, many either mythical or not native to Greece (like the sphinx and lion respectively) were adapted from the Near East, accompanied by decorative motifs, such as the lotus and palmette.  These were shown much larger than the previous figures.  The Wild Goat Style is a regional variant, very often showing goats. Human figures were not so influenced from the East, but also became larger and more detailed.[16]\nThe fully mature black-figure technique, with added red and white details and incising for outlines and details, originated in Corinth during the early 7th century BC and was introduced into Attica about a generation later; it flourished until the end of the 6th century BC.[17] The red-figure technique, invented in about 530 BC, reversed this tradition, with the pots being painted black and the figures painted in red. Red-figure vases slowly replaced the black-figure style. Sometimes larger vessels were engraved as well as painted. Erotic themes, both heterosexual and male homosexual, became common.[18]\nBy about 320 BC fine figurative vase-painting had ceased in Athens and other Greek centres, with the polychromatic Kerch style a final flourish; it was probably replaced by metalwork for most of its functions. West Slope Ware, with decorative motifs on a black glazed body, continued for over a century after.[19] Italian red-figure painting ended by about 300, and in the next century the relatively primitive Hadra vases, probably from Crete, Centuripe ware from Sicily, and Panathenaic amphorae, now a frozen tradition, were the only large painted vases still made.[20]\n\nMiddle Geometric krater, 99cm high, Attic, c. 800-775 BC\nLate Geometric pyxis, British Museum\nCorinthian orientalising jug, c. 620 BC, Antikensammlungen Munich\nBlack-figure olpe (wine vessel) by the Amasis Painter, depicting Herakles and Athena, c. 540 BC, Louvre\nInterior (tondo) of a red figure kylix, depicting Herakles and Athena, by Phoinix (potter) and Douris (painter), c. 480-470 BC, Antikensammlungen Munich\nDetail of a red-figure amphora depicting a satyr assaulting a maenad, by Pamphaios (potter) and Oltos (painter), c. 520 BC, Louvre\nWhite-ground lekythos with a scene of mourning by the Reed Painter, c. 420-410 BC, British Museum\nHellenistic relief bowl with the head of a maenad, 2nd century BC (?), British Museum\n\nMetalwork\n\nFine metalwork was an important art in ancient Greece, but later production is very poorly represented by survivals, most of which come from the edges of the Greek world or beyond, from as far as France or Russia.  Vessels and jewellery were produced to high standards, and exported far afield. Objects in silver, at the time worth more relative to gold than it is in modern times, were often inscribed by the maker with their weight, as they were treated largely as stores of value, and likely to be sold or re-melted before very long.[22]\nDuring the Geometric and Archaic phases, the production of large metal vessels was an important expression of Greek creativity, and an important stage in the development of bronzeworking techniques, such as casting and repousse hammering. Early sanctuaries, especially Olympia, yielded many hundreds of tripod-bowl or sacrificial tripod vessels, mostly in bronze, deposited as votives.  These had a shallow bowl with two handles raised high on three legs; in later versions the stand and bowl were different pieces. During the Orientalising period, such tripods were frequently decorated with figural protomes, in the shape of griffins, sphinxes and other fantastic creatures.[23]\nSwords, the Greek helmet and often body armour such as the muscle cuirass were made of bronze, sometimes decorated in precious metal, as in the 3rd-century Ksour Essef cuirass.[24]  Armour and \"shield-bands\" are two of the contexts for strips of Archaic low relief scenes, which were also attached to various objects in wood; the band on the Vix Krater is a large example.[25]  Polished bronze mirrors, initially with decorated backs and kore handles, were another common item; the later \"folding mirror\" type had hinged cover pieces, often decorated with a relief scene, typically erotic.[26] Coins are described below.\nFrom the late Archaic the best metalworking kept pace with stylistic developments in sculpture and the other arts, and Phidias is among the sculptors known to have practiced it.[27]  Hellenistic taste encouraged highly intricate displays of technical virtuousity, tending to \"cleverness, whimsy, or excessive elegance\".[28]  Many or most Greek pottery shapes were taken from shapes first used in metal, and in recent decades there has been an increasing view that much of the finest vase-painting reused designs by silversmiths for vessels with engraving and sections plated in a different metal, working from drawn designs.[29]\nExceptional survivals of what may have been a relatively common class of large bronze vessels are two volute kraters, for mixing wine and water.[30] These are the Vix Krater, c. 530 BC, 1.63m (5'4\") high and over 200kg (450lbs) in weight, holding some 1,100 litres, and found in the burial of a Celtic woman in modern France,[31] and the 4th-century Derveni Krater, 90.5cm (35 in.) high.[32]  The elites of other neighbours of the Greeks, such as the Thracians and Scythians, were keen consumers of Greek metalwork, and probably served by Greek goldsmiths settled in their territories, who adapted their products to suit local taste and functions.  Such hybrid pieces form a large part of survivals, including the Panagyurishte Treasure, Borovo Treasure, and other Thracian treasures, and several Scythian burials, which probably contained work by Greek artists based in the Greek settlements on the Black Sea.[33]  As with other luxury arts, the Macedonian royal cemetery at Vergina has produced objects of top quality from the cusp of the Classical and Hellenistic periods.[34]\nJewellery for the Greek market is often of superb quality,[35] with one unusual form being intricate and very delicate gold wreathes imitating plant-forms, worn on the head. These were probably rarely, if ever, worn in life, but were given as votives and worn in death.[36]  Many of the Fayum mummy portraits wear them.  Some pieces, especially in the Hellenistic period, are large enough to offer scope for figures, as did the Scythian taste for relatively substantial pieces in gold.[37]\n\nBronze griffin head protome from Olympia, 7th century BC\nThe Vix Krater, a late Archaic monumental bronze vessel, exported to French Celts\nFancy Early Classical bronze mirror with human caryatid handle, c. 460 BC\nGolden wreath, 370-360, from southern Italy\nSilver rhyton for the Thracian market, end 4th century[38]\n4th century BC Greek gold and bronze rhyton with head of Dionysus, Tamoikin Art Fund\nFragment of a gold wreath, c. 320-300 BC, from a burial in Crimea\nGold hair ornament and net, 3rd century BC\nLate Hellenistic silver medallion\n\nMonumental sculpture\n\n\nThe Greeks decided very early on that the human form was the most important subject for artistic endeavour.[39] Seeing their gods as having human form, there was little distinction between the sacred and the secular in art\u2014the human body was both secular and sacred. A male nude of Apollo or Heracles had only slight differences in treatment to one of that year's Olympic boxing champion. In the Archaic Period the most important sculptural form was the kouros (plural kouroi), the standing male nude (See for example Biton and Kleobis). The kore (plural korai), or standing clothed female figure, was also common, but since Greek society did not permit the public display of female nudity until the 4th century BC, the kore is considered to be of less importance in the development of sculpture.[40]  By the end of the period architectural sculpture on temples was becoming important.\nAs with pottery, the Greeks did not produce sculpture merely for artistic display. Statues were commissioned either by aristocratic individuals or by the state, and used for public memorials, as offerings to temples, oracles and sanctuaries (as is frequently shown by inscriptions on the statues), or as markers for graves. Statues in the Archaic period were not all intended to represent specific individuals. They were depictions of an ideal\u2014beauty, piety, honor or sacrifice. These were always depictions of young men, ranging in age from adolescence to early maturity, even when placed on the graves of (presumably) elderly citizens. Kouroi were all stylistically similar. Graduations in the social stature of the person commissioning the statue were indicated by size rather than artistic innovations.[41]\nUnlike authors, those who practiced the visual arts, including sculpture, initially had a low social status in ancient Greece, though increasingly leading sculptors might become famous and rather wealthy, and often signed their work (unfortunately, often on the plinth, which typically became separated from the statue itself).[42] Plutarch (Life of Pericles, II) said \"we admire the work of art but despise the maker of it\"; this was a common view in the ancient world. Ancient Greek sculpture is categorised by the usual stylistic periods of \"Archaic\", \"Classical\" and \"Hellenistic\", augmented with some extra ones mainly applying to sculpture, such as the Orientalizing Daedelic style and the Severe style of early Classical sculpture.[43]\nMaterials, forms\n\nSurviving ancient Greek sculptures were mostly made of two types of material. Stone, especially marble or other high-quality limestones was used most frequently and carved by hand with metal tools. Stone sculptures could be free-standing fully carved in the round (statues), or only partially carved reliefs still attached to a background plaque, for example in architectural friezes or grave stelai.[44]\nBronze statues were of higher status, but have survived in far smaller numbers, due to the reusability of metals. They were usually made in the lost wax technique. Chryselephantine, or gold-and-ivory, statues were the cult-images in temples and were regarded as the highest form of sculpture, but only some fragmentary pieces have survived.  They were normally over-lifesize, built around a wooden frame, with thin carved slabs of ivory representing the flesh, and sheets of gold leaf, probably over wood, representing the garments, armour, hair, and other details.[45]\nIn some cases, glass paste, glass, and precious and semi-precious stones were used for detail such as eyes, jewellery, and weaponry. Other large acrolithic statues used stone for the flesh parts, and wood for the rest, and marble statues sometimes had stucco hairstyles. Most sculpture was painted (see below), and much wore real jewellery and had inlaid eyes and other elements in different materials.[46]\nTerracotta was occasionally employed, for large statuary. Few examples of this survived, at least partially due to the fragility of such statues. The best known exception to this is a statue of Zeus carrying Ganymede found at Olympia, executed around 470 BC. In this case, the terracotta is painted.  There were undoubtedly sculptures purely in wood, which may have been very important in early periods, but effectively none have survived.[47]\nArchaic\n\nBronze Age Cycladic art, to about 1100 BC, had already shown an unusual focus on the human figure, usually shown in a straightforward frontal standing position with arms folded across the stomach.  Among the smaller features only noses, sometimes eyes, and female breasts were carved, though the figures were apparently usually painted and may have originally looked very different.\nInspired by the monumental stone sculpture of Egypt and Mesopotamia, during the Archaic period the Greeks began again to carve in stone. Free-standing figures share the solidity and frontal stance characteristic of Eastern models, but their forms are more dynamic than those of Egyptian sculpture, as for example the Lady of Auxerre and Torso of Hera (Early Archaic period, c. 660\u2013580 BC, both in the Louvre, Paris). After about 575 BC, figures, such as these, both male and female, wore the so-called archaic smile. This expression, which has no specific appropriateness to the person or situation depicted, may have been a device to give the figures a distinctive human characteristic.[48]\nThree types of figures prevailed\u2014the standing nude youth (kouros), the standing draped girl (kore) and, less frequently, the seated woman.[49] All emphasize and generalize the essential features of the human figure and show an increasingly accurate comprehension of human anatomy. The youths were either sepulchral or votive statues. Examples are Apollo (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), an early work; the Strangford Apollo from Anafi (British Museum, London), a much later work; and the Anavyssos Kouros (National Archaeological Museum of Athens). More of the musculature and skeletal structure is visible in this statue than in earlier works. The standing, draped girls have a wide range of expression, as in the sculptures in the Acropolis Museum of Athens. Their drapery is carved and painted with the delicacy and meticulousness common in the details of sculpture of this period.[50]\nArchaic reliefs have survived from many tombs, and from larger buildings at Foce del Sele (now in the museum at Paestum) in Italy, with two groups of metope panels, from about 550 and 510, and the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi, with friezes and a small pediment.  Parts, all now in local museums, survive of the large triangular pediment groups from the Temple of Artemis, Corfu (c. 580), dominated by a huge Gorgon, and the Old Temple of Athena in Athens (c. 530-500).[51]\n\nDipylon Kouros, c. 600 BC, Athens, Kerameikos Museum\nThe Moschophoros or calf-bearer, c. 570 BC, Athens, Acropolis Museum\nPeplos Kore, c. 530 BC, Athens, Acropolis Museum\nFrieze of the Siphnian Treasury, Delphi, depicting a Gigantomachy, c. 525 BC, Delphi Archaeological Museum\nThe Strangford Apollo, 500-490, one of the last kouroi\nThe Sabouroff head, an important example of Late Archaic Greek marble sculpture, ca. 550-525 BCE.\nThe Perserschutt, or \"Persian rubble\", dating from the destruction of Athens in 480\/479 BC during the Second Persian invasion of Greece offer a clear datation marker for Archaic statuary.\n\nClassical\n\n\nIn the Classical period there was a revolution in Greek statuary, usually associated with the introduction of democracy and the end of the aristocratic culture associated with the kouroi. The Classical period saw changes in the style and function of sculpture. Poses became more naturalistic (see the Charioteer of Delphi for an example of the transition to more naturalistic sculpture), and the technical skill of Greek sculptors in depicting the human form in a variety of poses greatly increased. From about 500 BC statues began to depict real people. The statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton set up in Athens to mark the overthrow of the tyranny were said to be the first public monuments to actual people.[52]\n\nAt the same time sculpture and statues were put to wider uses. The great temples of the Classical era such as the Parthenon in Athens, and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, required relief sculpture for decorative friezes, and sculpture in the round to fill the triangular fields of the pediments. The difficult aesthetic and technical challenge stimulated much in the way of sculptural innovation. Unfortunately these works survive only in fragments, the most famous of which are the Parthenon Marbles, half of which are in the British Museum.[55]\nFuneral statuary evolved during this period from the rigid and impersonal kouros of the Archaic period to the highly personal family groups of the Classical period. These monuments are commonly found in the suburbs of Athens, which in ancient times were cemeteries on the outskirts of the city. Although some of them depict \"ideal\" types\u2014the mourning mother, the dutiful son\u2014they increasingly depicted real people, typically showing the departed taking his dignified leave from his family. They are among the most intimate and affecting remains of the ancient Greeks.[56]\nIn the Classical period for the first time we know the names of individual sculptors. Phidias oversaw the design and building of the Parthenon. Praxiteles made the female nude respectable for the first time in the Late Classical period (mid-4th century): his Aphrodite of Knidos, which survives in copies, was said by Pliny to be the greatest statue in the world.[57]\nThe most famous works of the Classical period for contemporaries were the colossal Statue of Zeus at Olympia and the Statue of Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon. Both were chryselephantine and executed by Phidias or under his direction, and are now lost, although smaller copies (in other materials) and good descriptions of both still exist. Their size and magnificence prompted emperors to seize them in the Byzantine period, and both were removed to Constantinople, where they were later destroyed in fires.[58]\n\nCopy of Polyclitus' Diadumenos, National Archaeological Museum, Athens\nSo-called Venus Braschi by Praxiteles, type of the Knidian Aphrodite, Munich Glyptothek\nThe Marathon Youth, 4th-century BC bronze statue, possibly by Praxiteles, National Archaeological Museum, Athens\nHermes, possibly by Lysippos, National Archaeological Museum, Athens\n\nHellenistic\n\n\nThe transition from the Classical to the Hellenistic period occurred during the 4th century BC. Following the conquests of Alexander the Great (336 BC to 323 BC), Greek culture spread as far as India, as revealed by the excavations of Ai-Khanoum in eastern Afghanistan, and the civilization of the Greco-Bactrians and the Indo-Greeks. Greco-Buddhist art represented a syncretism between Greek art and the visual expression of Buddhism.  Thus Greek art became more diverse and more influenced by the cultures of the peoples drawn into the Greek orbit.[59]\nIn the view of some art historians, it also declined in quality and originality. This, however, is a judgement which artists and art-lovers of the time would not have shared. Indeed, many sculptures previously considered as classical masterpieces are now recognised as being Hellenistic.  The technical ability of Hellenistic sculptors is clearly in evidence in such major works as the Winged Victory of Samothrace, and the Pergamon Altar. New centres of Greek culture, particularly in sculpture, developed in Alexandria, Antioch, Pergamum, and other cities, where the new monarchies were lavish patrons.[60] By the 2nd century the rising power of Rome had also absorbed much of the Greek tradition\u2014and an increasing proportion of its products as well.[61]\nDuring this period sculpture became more naturalistic, and also expressive; the interest in depicting extremes of emotion being sometimes pushed to extremes. Genre subjects of common people, women, children, animals and domestic scenes became acceptable subjects for sculpture, which was commissioned by wealthy families for the adornment of their homes and gardens; the Boy with Thorn is an example. Realistic portraits of men and women of all ages were produced, and sculptors no longer felt obliged to depict people as ideals of beauty or physical perfection.[62]\nThe world of Dionysus, a pastoral idyll populated by satyrs, maenads, nymphs and sileni, had been often depicted in earlier vase painting and figurines, but rarely in full-size sculpture.  Now such works were made, surviving in copies including the Barberini Faun, the Belvedere Torso, and the Resting Satyr; the Furietti Centaurs and Sleeping Hermaphroditus reflect related themes.[63]  At the same time, the new Hellenistic cities springing up all over Egypt, Syria, and Anatolia required statues depicting the gods and heroes of Greece for their temples and public places. This made sculpture, like pottery, an industry, with the consequent standardisation and some lowering of quality. For these reasons many more Hellenistic statues have survived than is the case with the Classical period.\nSome of the best known Hellenistic sculptures are the Winged Victory of Samothrace (2nd or 1st century BC),[64] the statue of Aphrodite from the island of Melos known as the Venus de Milo (mid-2nd century BC), the Dying Gaul (about 230 BC), and the monumental group Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons (late 1st century BC). All these statues depict Classical themes, but their treatment is far more sensuous and emotional than the austere taste of the Classical period would have allowed or its technical skills permitted.\nThe multi-figure group of statues was a Hellenistic innovation, probably of the 3rd century, taking the epic battles of earlier temple pediment reliefs off their walls, and placing them as life-size groups of statues.  Their style is often called \"baroque\", with extravagantly contorted body poses, and intense expressions in the faces. The reliefs on the Pergamon Altar are the nearest original survivals, but several well known works are believed to be Roman copies of Hellenistic originals. These include the Dying Gaul and Ludovisi Gaul, as well as a less well known Kneeling Gaul and others, all believed to copy Pergamene commissions by Attalus I to commemorate his victory around 241 over the Gauls of Galatia, probably comprising two groups.[65]\nThe Laoco\u00f6n Group, the Farnese Bull, Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus (\"Pasquino group\"), Arrotino, and the Sperlonga sculptures, are other examples.[66]  From the 2nd century the Neo-Attic or Neo-Classical style is seen by different scholars as either a reaction to baroque excesses, returning to a version of Classical style, or as a continuation of the traditional style for cult statues.[67]   Workshops in the style became mainly producers of copies for the Roman market, which preferred copies of Classical rather than Hellenistic pieces.[68]\nDiscoveries made since the end of the 19th century surrounding the (now submerged) ancient Egyptian city of Heracleum include a 4th-century BC, unusually sensual, detailed and feministic (as opposed to deified) depiction of Isis, marking a combination of Egyptian and Hellenistic forms beginning around the time of Egypt's conquest by Alexander the Great. However this was untypical of Ptolemaic court sculpture, which generally avoided mixing Egyptian styles with its fairly conventional Hellenistic style,[69] while temples in the rest of the country continued using late versions of traditional Egyptian formulae.[70] Scholars have proposed an \"Alexandrian style\" in Hellenistic sculpture, but there is in fact little to connect it with Alexandria.[71]\nHellenistic sculpture was also marked by an increase in scale, which culminated in the Colossus of Rhodes (late 3rd century), which was the same size as the Statue of Liberty. The combined effect of earthquakes and looting have destroyed this as well as other very large works of this period.\n\nStatue of a prince or dynast without crown, traditionally thought to be a Seleucid prince, maybe Attalus II of Pergamon.

During the 8th century BC tombs in Boeotia often contain \"bell idols\", female statuettes with mobile legs: the head, small compared to the remainder of the body, is perched at the end of a long neck, while the body is very full, in the shape of a bell.[72] Archaic heroon tombs, for local heroes, might receive large numbers of crudely-shaped figurines, with rudimentary figuration, generally representing characters with raised arms.\nBy the Hellenistic period most terracotta figurines have lost their religious nature, and represent characters from everyday life. Tanagra figurines, from one of several centres of production, are mass-manufactured using moulds, and then painted after firing. Dolls, figures of fashionably-dressed ladies and of actors, some of these probably portraits, were among the new subjects, depicted with a refined style.  These were cheap, and initially displayed in the home much like modern ornamental figurines, but were quite often buried with their owners. At the same time, cities like Alexandria, Smyrna or Tarsus produced an abundance of grotesque figurines, representing individuals with deformed members, eyes bulging and contorting themselves. Such figurines were also made from bronze.[73]\nFor painted architectural terracottas, see Architecture below.\nMetal figurines\nFigurines made of metal, primarily bronze, are an extremely common find at early Greek sanctuaries like Olympia, where thousands of such objects, mostly depicting animals, have been found. They are usually produced in the lost wax technique and can be considered the initial stage in the development of Greek bronze sculpture. The most common motifs during the Geometric period were horses and deer, but dogs, cattle and other animals are also depicted. Human figures occur occasionally. The production of small metal votives continued throughout Greek antiquity. In the Classical and Hellenistic periods, more elaborate bronze statuettes, closely connected with monumental sculpture, also became common.  High quality examples were keenly collected by wealthy Greeks, and later Romans, but relatively few have survived.[74]\n\nBell Idol, 7th century BC\n8th-century BC bronze votive horse from Olympia\nActor from the New Comedy, about 200 BC\nTanagra figurine of fashionable lady, 32.5cm (12.8in), 330-300 BC\n\nArchitecture\n\n\n\nArchitecture (meaning buildings executed to an aesthetically considered design) ceased in Greece from the end of the Mycenaean period (about 1200 BC) until the 7th century, when urban life and prosperity recovered to a point where public building could be undertaken. Since most Greek buildings in the Archaic and Early Classical periods were made of wood or mud-brick, nothing remains of them except a few ground-plans, and there are almost no written sources on early architecture or descriptions of buildings. Most of our knowledge of Greek architecture comes from the surviving buildings of the Late Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods (since ancient Roman architecture heavily used Greek styles), and from late written sources such as Vitruvius (1st century BC). This means that there is a strong bias towards temples, the most common major buildings to survive.  Here the squared blocks of stone used for walls were useful for later buildings, and so often all that survives are parts of columns and metopes that were harder to recycle.[75]\nFor most of the period a strict stone post and lintel system of construction was used, held in place only by gravity. Corbelling was known in Mycenean Greece, and the arch was known from the 5th century at the latest, but hardly any use was made of these techniques until the Roman period.[76]  Wood was only used for ceilings and roof timbers in prestigious stone buildings.  The use of large terracotta roof tiles, only held in place by grooving, meant that roofs needed to have a low pitch.[77]\nUntil Hellenistic times only public buildings were built using the formal stone style; these included above all temples, and the smaller treasury buildings which often accompanied them, and were built at Delphi by many cities.  Other building types, often not roofed, were the central agora, often with one or more colonnaded stoa around it, theatres, the gymnasium and palaestra or wrestling-school, the ekklesiasterion or bouleuterion for assemblies, and the propylaea or monumental gateways.[78]  Round buildings for various functions were called a tholos,[79] and the largest stone structures were often defensive city walls. \nTombs were for most of the period only made as elaborate mausolea around the edges of the Greek world, especially in Anatolia.[80]  Private houses were built around a courtyard where funds allowed, and showed blank walls to the street.  They sometimes had a second story, but very rarely basements.  They were usually built of rubble at best, and relatively little is known about them; at least for males, much of life was spent outside them.[81]  A few palaces from the Hellenistic period have been excavated.[82]\nTemples and some other buildings such as the treasuries at Delphi were planned as either a cube or, more often, a rectangle made from limestone, of which Greece has an abundance, and which was cut into large blocks and dressed.  This was supplemented by columns, at least on the entrance front, and often on all sides.[83]  Other buildings were more flexible in plan, and even the wealthiest houses seem to have lacked much external ornament.  Marble was an expensive building material in Greece: high quality marble came only from Mt Pentelus in Attica and from a few islands such as Paros, and its transportation in large blocks was difficult. It was used mainly for sculptural decoration, not structurally, except in the very grandest buildings of the Classical period such as the Parthenon in Athens.[84]\nThere were two main classical orders of Greek architecture, the Doric and the Ionic, with the Corinthian order only appearing in the Classical period, and not becoming dominant until the Roman period. The most obvious features of the three orders are the capitals of the columns, but there are significant differences in other points of design and decoration between the orders.[85]  These names were used by the Greeks themselves, and reflected their belief that the styles descended from the Dorian and Ionian Greeks of the Dark Ages, but this is unlikely to be true. The Doric was the earliest, probably first appearing in stone in the earlier 7th century, having developed (though perhaps not very directly) from predecessors in wood.[86]  It was used in mainland Greece and the Greek colonies in Italy. The Ionic style was first used in the cities of Ionia (now the west coast of Turkey) and some of the Aegean islands, probably beginning in the 6th century.[87] The Doric style was more formal and austere, the Ionic more relaxed and decorative. The more ornate Corinthian order was a later development of the Ionic, initially apparently only used inside buildings, and using Ionic forms for everything except the capitals. The famous and well-preserved Choragic Monument of Lysicrates near the Athens Acropolis (335\/334) is the first known use of the Corinthian order on the exterior of a building.[88]\nMost of the best known surviving Greek buildings, such as the Parthenon and the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, are Doric. The Erechtheum, next to the Parthenon, however, is Ionic. The Ionic order became dominant in the Hellenistic period, since its more decorative style suited the aesthetic of the period better than the more restrained Doric. Some of the best surviving Hellenistic buildings, such as the Library of Celsus, can be seen in Turkey, at cities such as Ephesus and Pergamum.[89] But in the greatest of Hellenistic cities, Alexandria in Egypt, almost nothing survives.\n\nThe Erechtheion on the Acropolis of Athens, late 5th century BC\nModel of the processional way at Ancient Delphi, without much of the statuary shown.[90]\nChoragic Monument of Lysicrates, Athens, 335\/334\nThe theatre of Epidauros, 4th century BC\n\nCoin design\n\n\n\nCoins were (probably) invented in Lydia in the 7th century BC, but they were first extensively used by the Greeks,[91] and the Greeks set the canon of coin design which has been followed ever since. Coin design today still recognisably follows patterns descended from ancient Greece. The Greeks did not see coin design as a major art form, although some were expensively designed by leading goldsmiths, especially outside Greece itself, among the Central Asian kingdoms and in Sicilian cities keen to promote themselves.  Nevertheless, the durability and abundance of coins have made them one of the most important sources of knowledge about Greek aesthetics.[92] Greek coins are the only art form from the ancient Greek world which can still be bought and owned by private collectors of modest means.\nThe most widespread coins, used far beyond their native territories and copied and forged by others, were the Athenian tetradrachm, issued from c. 510 to c. 38 BC, and in the Hellenistic age the Macedonian tetradrachm, both silver.[93] These both kept the same familiar design for long periods.[94]  Greek designers began the practice of putting a profile portrait on the obverse of coins. This was initially a symbolic portrait of the patron god or goddess of the city issuing the coin: Athena for Athens, Apollo at Corinth, Demeter at Thebes and so on. Later, heads of heroes of Greek mythology were used, such as Heracles on the coins of Alexander the Great. \nThe first human portraits on coins were those of Achaemenid Empire Satraps in Asia Minor, starting with the exiled Athenian general Themistocles who became a Satrap of Magnesia circa 450 BC, and continuing especially with the dynasts of Lycia towards the end of the 5th century.[95] Greek cities in Italy such as Syracuse began to put the heads of real people on coins in the 4th century BC, as did the Hellenistic successors of Alexander the Great in Egypt, Syria and elsewhere.[96] On the reverse of their coins the Greek cities often put a symbol of the city: an owl for Athens, a dolphin for Syracuse and so on. The placing of inscriptions on coins also began in Greek times. All these customs were later continued by the Romans.[92]\nThe most artistically ambitious coins, designed by goldsmiths or gem-engravers, were often from the edges of the Greek world, from new colonies in the early period and new kingdoms later, as a form of marketing their \"brands\" in modern terms.[97]  Of the larger cities, Corinth and Syracuse also issued consistently attractive coins. Some of the Greco-Bactrian coins are considered the finest examples of Greek coins with large portraits with \"a nice blend of realism and idealization\", including the largest coins to be minted in the Hellenistic world: the largest gold coin was minted by Eucratides (reigned 171\u2013145 BC), the largest silver coin by the Indo-Greek king Amyntas Nikator (reigned c. 95\u201390 BC). The portraits \"show a degree of individuality never matched by the often bland depictions of their royal contemporaries further West\".[98]\n\nArethusa on a coin of Syracuse, Sicily, 415-400\nDrachm of Aegina with tortoise and stamp, after 404 BC\nHeracles fighting lion.

The ekphrasis was a literary form consisting of a description of a work of art, and we have a considerable body of literature on Greek painting and painters, with further additions in Latin, though none of the treatises by artists that are mentioned have survived.[99]  Unfortunately we have hardly any of the most prestigious sort of paintings, on wood panel or in fresco, that this literature was concerned with.  \nThe contrast with vase-painting is total. There are no mentions in literature at all, but over 100,000 surviving examples, giving many individual painters a respectable surviving oeuvre.[100]  Our idea of what the best Greek painting was like must be drawn from a careful consideration of parallels in vase-painting, late Greco-Roman copies in mosaic and fresco, some very late examples of actual painting in the Greek tradition, and the ancient literature.[101]\nThere were several interconnected traditions of painting in ancient Greece. Due to their technical differences, they underwent somewhat differentiated developments.  Early painting seems to have developed along similar lines to vase-painting, heavily reliant on outline and flat areas of colour, but then flowered and developed at the time that vase-painting went into decline.  By the end of the Hellenistic period, technical developments included modelling to indicate contours in forms, shadows, foreshortening, some probably imprecise form of perspective, interior and landscape backgrounds, and the use of changing colours to suggest distance in landscapes, so that \"Greek artists had all the technical devices needed for fully illusionistic painting\".[102]\nPanel and wall painting\n\nThe most common and respected form of art, according to authors like Pliny or Pausanias, were panel paintings, individual, portable paintings on wood boards. The techniques used were encaustic (wax) painting and tempera. Such paintings normally depicted figural scenes, including portraits and still-lifes; we have descriptions of many compositions. They were collected and often displayed in public spaces. Pausanias describes such exhibitions at Athens and Delphi. We know the names of many famous painters, mainly of the Classical and Hellenistic periods, from literature (see expandable list to the right). The most famous of all ancient Greek painters was Apelles of Kos, whom Pliny the Elder lauded as having \"surpassed all the other painters who either preceded or succeeded him.\"[103][104]\nUnfortunately, due to the perishable nature of the materials used and the major upheavals at the end of antiquity, not one of the famous works of Greek panel painting has survived, nor even any of the copies that doubtlessly existed, and which give us most of our knowledge of Greek sculpture.  We have slightly more significant survivals of mural compositions. The most important surviving Greek examples from before the Roman period are the fairly low-quality Pitsa panels from c. 530 BC,[105] the Tomb of the Diver from Paestum, and various paintings from the royal tombs at Vergina.  More numerous paintings in Etruscan and Campanian tombs are based on Greek styles.  In the Roman period, there are a number of wall paintings in Pompeii and the surrounding area, as well as in Rome itself, some of which are thought to be copies of specific earlier masterpieces.[106]\nIn particular copies of specific wall-paintings have been confidently identified in the Alexander Mosaic and Villa Boscoreale.[107]  There is a large group of much later Greco-Roman archaeological survivals from the dry conditions of Egypt, the Fayum mummy portraits, together with the similar Severan Tondo, and a small group of painted portrait miniatures in gold glass.[108] Byzantine icons are also derived from the encaustic panel painting tradition, and Byzantine illuminated manuscripts sometimes continued a Greek illusionistic style for centuries.\n\nThe tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the Minoan and Mycenaean Bronze Age, with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like Knossos, Tiryns and Mycenae. It is not clear, whether there is any continuity between these antecedents and later Greek wall paintings.\nWall paintings are frequently described in Pausanias, and many appear to have been produced in the Classical and Hellenistic periods. Due to the lack of architecture surviving intact, not many are preserved. The most notable examples are a monumental Archaic 7th-century BC scene of hoplite combat from inside a temple at Kalapodi (near Thebes), and the elaborate frescoes from the 4th-century \"Grave of Phillipp\" and the \"Tomb of Persephone\" at Vergina in Macedonia, or the tomb at Agios Athanasios, Thessaloniki, sometimes suggested to be closely linked to the high-quality panel paintings mentioned above.\nGreek wall painting tradition is also reflected in contemporary grave decorations in the Greek colonies in Italy, e.g. the famous Tomb of the Diver at Paestum. Some scholars suggest that the celebrated Roman frescoes at sites like Pompeii are the direct descendants of Greek tradition, and that some of them copy famous panel paintings.\n\n\n\nAncient Macedonian paintings of armour, arms, and gear from the Tomb of Lyson and Kallikles in ancient Mieza (modern-day Lefkadia), Imathia, Central Macedonia, Greece, 2nd century BC.\nA stele of Dioskourides, dated 2nd century BC, showing a Ptolemaic thyreophoros soldier, a characteristic example of the \"Romanization\" of the Ptolemaic army\nFresco from the Tomb of Judgment in ancient Mieza (modern-day Lefkadia), Imathia, Central Macedonia, Greece, depicting religious imagery of the afterlife, 4th century BC\nA fresco showing Hades and Persephone riding in a chariot, from the tomb of Queen Eurydice I of Macedon at Vergina, Greece, 4th century BC\nA banquet scene from a Macedonian tomb of Agios Athanasios, Thessaloniki, 4th century BC; six men are shown reclining on couches, with food arranged on nearby tables, a male servant in attendance, and female musicians providing entertainment.[109]\nFresco of an ancient Macedonian soldier (thorakitai) wearing chainmail armor and bearing a thureos shield, 3rd century BC\nThe Sampul tapestry, a woollen wall hanging from Lop County, Xinjiang, China, showing a possibly Greek soldier from the Greco-Bactrian kingdom (250\u2013125 BC), with blue eyes, wielding a spear, and wearing what appears to be a diadem headband; depicted above him is a centaur, from Greek mythology, a common motif in Hellenistic art;[110] Xinjiang Region Museum.\n\nPolychromy: painting on statuary and architecture\n\nMuch of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully. This aspect of Greek stonework is described as polychrome (from Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd = many and \u03c7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1 = colour). Due to intensive weathering, polychromy on sculpture and architecture has substantially or totally faded in most cases.\nAlthough the word polychrome is created from the combining of two Greek words, it was not used in ancient Greece. The term was coined in the early nineteenth century by Antoine Chrysost\u00f4me Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy.[111]\nArchitecture\nPainting was also used to enhance the visual aspects of architecture. Certain parts of the superstructure of Greek temples were habitually painted since the Archaic period. Such architectural polychromy could take the form of bright colours directly applied to the stone (evidenced e.g. on the Parthenon, or of elaborate patterns, frequently architectural members made of terracotta (Archaic examples at Olympia and Delphi). Sometimes, the terracottas also depicted figural scenes, as do the 7th-century BC terracotta metopes from Thermon.[112]\n\nSculpture\nMost Greek sculptures were painted in strong and bright colors; this is called \"polychromy\". The paint was frequently limited to parts depicting clothing, hair, and so on, with the skin left in the natural color of the stone or bronze, but it could also cover sculptures in their totality; female skin in marble tended to be uncoloured, while male skin might be a light brown. The painting of Greek sculpture should not merely be seen as an enhancement of their sculpted form, but has the characteristics of a distinct style of art.[113]\nFor example, the pedimental sculptures from the Temple of Aphaia on Aegina have recently been demonstrated to have been painted with bold and elaborate patterns, depicting, amongst other details, patterned clothing. The polychromy of stone statues was paralleled by the use of different materials to distinguish skin, clothing and other details in chryselephantine sculptures, and by the use of different metals to depict lips, fingernails, etc. on high-quality bronzes like the Riace bronzes.[113]\nVase painting\nThe most copious evidence of ancient Greek painting survives in the form of vase paintings. These are described in the \"pottery\" section above. They give at least some sense of the aesthetics of Greek painting.  The techniques involved, however, were very different from those used in large-format painting. The same probably applies to the subject matter depicted. It should be noted that strictly speaking, vase painting was a separate skill or art from potting. It should also be kept in mind that vase painting, albeit by far the most conspicuous surviving source on ancient Greek painting, was not held in the highest regard in antiquity, and is never mentioned in Classical literature.[114]\nMosaics\n\n\n\nMosaics were initially made with rounded pebbles, and later glass with tesserae which gave more colour and a flat surface. They were popular in the Hellenistic period, at first as decoration for the floors of palaces, but eventually for private homes.[116] Often a central emblema picture in a central panel was completed in much finer work than the surrounding decoration.[117] Xenia motifs, where a house showed examples of the variety of foods guests might expect to enjoy, provide most of the surviving specimens of Greek still-life.  In general mosaic must be considered as a secondary medium copying painting, often very directly, as in the Alexander Mosaic.[118]\nThe Unswept Floor by Sosus of Pergamon (c. 200 BC) was an original and famous trompe l'oeil piece, known from many Greco-Roman copies. According to John Boardman, Sosus is the only mosaic artist whose name has survived; his Doves are also mentioned in literature and copied.[119] However, Katherine M. D. Dunbabin asserts that two different mosaic artists left their signatures on mosaics of Delos.[120] The artist of the 4th-century BC Stag Hunt Mosaic perhaps also left his signature as Gnosis, although this word may be a reference to the abstract concept of knowledge.[121]\nMosaics are a significant element of surviving Macedonian art, with a large number of examples preserved in the ruins of Pella, the ancient Macedonian capital, in today's Central Macedonia.[122] Mosaics such as the \"Stag Hunt Mosaic and Lion Hunt\" mosaic demonstrate illusionist and three dimensional qualities generally found in Hellenistic paintings, although the rustic Macedonian pursuit of hunting is markedly more pronounced than other themes.[123] The 2nd-century-BC mosaics of Delos, Greece were judged by Fran\u00e7ois Chamoux as representing the pinnacle of Hellenistic mosaic art, with similar styles that continued throughout the Roman period and perhaps laid the foundations for the widespread use of mosaics in the Western world through to the Middle Ages.[116]\n\nA mosaic of the Kasta Tomb in Amphipolis depicting the abduction of Persephone by Pluto, 4th century BC\nCentral panel of the Abduction of Helen by Theseus, floor mosaic, detail of the charioteer, from the House of the Abduction of Helen, (c. 300 BC), ancient Pella\nAlexander the Great (left), wearing a kausia and fighting an Asiatic lion with his friend Craterus (detail); late 4th-century BC mosaic from Pella[124]\nMosaic of a nymph from the Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes, 2nd century BC\nThe winged god Dionysus riding a tiger, from the House of Dionysus in Delos, Greece, 2nd century BC\nDetail of floor panel with Alexandrine parakeet, Pergamon  modern Turkey, middle 2nd century BC (reigns of Eumenes II and Attalus II)\nPtolemaic mosaic of a dog and askos wine vessel from Hellenistic Egypt, dated 200-150 BC\nHellenistic mosaic from Thmuis (Mendes), Egypt, signed by Sophilos c. 200 BC; Ptolemaic Queen Berenice II (joint ruler with her husband Ptolemy III) as the personification of Alexandria.[125]\n\nEngraved gems\n\nThe engraved gem was a luxury art with high prestige; Pompey and Julius Caesar were among later collectors.[126] The technique has an ancient tradition in the Near East, and cylinder seals, whose design only appears when rolled over damp clay, from which the flat ring type developed, spread to the Minoan world, including parts of Greece and Cyprus.  The Greek tradition emerged under Minoan influence on mainland Helladic culture, and reached an apogee of subtlety and refinement in the Hellenistic period.[127]\nRound or oval Greek gems (along with similar objects in bone and ivory) are found from the 8th and 7th centuries BC, usually with animals in energetic geometric poses, often with a border marked by dots or a rim.[128] Early examples are mostly in softer stones. Gems of the 6th century are more often oval,[129] with a scarab back (in the past this type was called a \"scarabaeus\"), and human or divine figures as well as animals; the scarab form was apparently adopted from Phoenicia.[130]\nThe forms are sophisticated for the period, despite the usually small size of the gems.[94] In the 5th century gems became somewhat larger, but still only 2\u20133 centimetres tall. Despite this, very fine detail is shown, including the eyelashes on one male head, perhaps a portrait. Four gems signed by Dexamenos of Chios are the finest of the period, two showing herons.[131]\nRelief carving became common in 5th century BC Greece, and gradually most of the spectacular carved gems were in relief.  Generally a relief image is more impressive than an intaglio one; in the earlier form the recipient of a document saw this in the impressed sealing wax, while in the later reliefs it was the owner of the seal who kept it for himself, probably marking the emergence of gems meant to be collected or worn as jewellery pendants in necklaces and the like, rather than used as seals \u2013 later ones are sometimes rather large to use to seal letters. However inscriptions are usually still in reverse (\"mirror-writing\") so they only read correctly on impressions (or by viewing from behind with transparent stones). This aspect also partly explains the collecting of impressions in plaster or wax from gems, which may be easier to appreciate than the original.\nLarger hardstone carvings and cameos, which are rare in intaglio form, seem to have reached Greece around the 3rd century; the Farnese Tazza is the only major surviving Hellenistic example (depending on the dates assigned to the Gonzaga Cameo and the Cup of the Ptolemies), but other glass-paste imitations with portraits suggest that gem-type cameos were made in this period.[132] The conquests of Alexander had opened up new trade routes to the Greek world and increased the range of gemstones available.[133]\nOrnament\n\nThe synthesis in the Archaic period of the native repertoire of simple geometric motifs with imported, mostly plant-based, motifs from further east created a sizeable vocabulary of ornament, which artists and craftsmen used with confidence and fluency.[134] Today this vocabulary is seen above all in the large corpus of painted pottery, as well as in architectural remains, but it would have originally been used in a wide range of media, as a later version of it is used in European Neoclassicism.\nElements in this vocabulary include the geometrical meander or \"Greek key\", egg-and-dart, bead and reel, Vitruvian scroll, guilloche, and from the plant world the stylized acanthus leaves, volute, palmette and half-palmette, plant scrolls of various kinds, rosette, lotus flower, and papyrus flower. Originally used prominently on Archaic vases, as figurative painting developed these were usually relegated to serve as borders demarcating edges of the vase or different zones of decoration.[135] Greek architecture was notable for developing sophisticated conventions for using mouldings and other architectural ornamental elements, which used these motifs in a harmoniously integrated whole.\nEven before the Classical period, this vocabulary had influenced Celtic art, and the expansion of the Greek world after Alexander, and the export of Greek objects still further afield, exposed much of Eurasia to it, including the regions in the north of the Indian subcontinent where Buddhism was expanding, and creating Greco-Buddhist art.  As Buddhism spread across Central Asia to China and the rest of East Asia, in a form that made great use of religious art, versions of this vocabulary were taken with it and used to surround images of buddhas and other religious images, often with a size and emphasis that would have seemed excessive to the ancient Greeks.  The vocabulary was absorbed into the ornament of India, China, Persia and other Asian countries, as well as developing further in Byzantine art.[136]  The Romans took over the vocabulary more or less in its entirety, and although much altered, it can be traced throughout European medieval art, especially in plant-based ornament.\nIslamic art, where ornament largely replaces figuration, developed the Byzantine plant scroll into the full, endless arabesque, and especially from the Mongol conquests of the 14th century received new influences from China, including the descendents of the Greek vocabulary.[137]   From the Renaissance onwards, several of these Asian styles were represented on textiles, porcelain and other goods imported into Europe, and influenced ornament there, a process that still continues.\nOther arts\n\nAlthough glass was made in Cyprus by the 9th century BC, and was considerably developed by the end of the period, there are only a few survivals of glasswork from before the Greco-Roman period that show the artistic quality of the best work.[138]  Most survivals are small perfume bottles, in fancy coloured \"feathered\" styles similar to other Mediterranean glass.[139] Hellenistic glass became cheaper and accessible to a wider population.\nNo Greek furniture has survived, but there are many images of it on vases and memorial reliefs, for example that to Hegeso. It was evidently often very elegant, as were the styles derived from it from the 18th century onwards.  Some pieces of carved ivory that were used as inlays have survived, as at Vergina, and a few ivory carvings; this was a luxury art that could be of very fine quality.[140]\nIt is clear from vase paintings that the Greeks often wore elaborately patterned clothes, and skill at weaving was the mark of the respectable woman.  Two luxurious pieces of cloth survive, from the tomb of Philip of Macedon.[141]  There are numerous references to decorative hangings for both homes and temples, but none of these have survived.\nDiffusion and legacy\n\nAncient Greek art has exercised considerable influence on the culture of many countries all over the world, above all in its treatment of the human figure.  In the West Greek architecture was also hugely influential, and in both East and West the influence of Greek decoration can be traced to the modern day. Etruscan and Roman art were largely and directly derived from Greek models,[142] and Greek objects and influence reached into Celtic art north of the Alps,[143] as well as all around the Mediterranean world and into Persia.[144]\nIn the East, Alexander the Great's conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and Indian cultures, which was greatly aided by the spread of Buddhism, which early on picked up many Greek traits and motifs in Greco-Buddhist art, which were then transmitted as part of a cultural package to East Asia, even as far as Japan, among artists who were no doubt completely unaware of the origin of the motifs and styles they used.[145]\nFollowing the Renaissance in Europe, the humanist aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists, with a major revival in the movement of Neoclassicism which began in the mid-18th century, coinciding with easier access from Western Europe to Greece itself, and a renewed importation of Greek originals, most notoriously the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon. Well into the 19th century, the classical tradition derived from Greece dominated the art of the western world.[146]\nHistoriography\n\nThe Hellenized Roman upper classes of the Late Republic and Early Empire generally accepted Greek superiority in the arts without many quibbles, though the praise of Pliny for the sculpture and painting of pre-Hellenistic artists may be based on earlier Greek writings rather than much personal knowledge.  Pliny and other classical authors were known in the Renaissance, and this assumption of Greek superiority was again generally accepted.  However critics in the Renaissance and much later were unclear which works were actually Greek.[147]\nDue to Ottoman Empire occupation, Greece itself could only be reached by a very few western Europeans until the mid-18th century.  Not only the Greek vases found in the Etruscan cemeteries, but also (more controversially) the Greek temples of Paestum were taken to be Etruscan, or otherwise Italic, until the late 18th century and beyond, a misconception prolonged by Italian nationalist sentiment.[147]\nThe writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, especially his books Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture (1750) and Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums (\"History of Ancient Art\", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day.[148]\nThe full disentangling of Greek statues from their later Roman copies, and a better understanding of the balance between Greekness and Roman-ness in Greco-Roman art was to take much longer, and perhaps still continues.[149]  Greek art, especially sculpture, continued to enjoy an enormous reputation, and studying and copying it was a large part of the training of artists, until the downfall of Academic art in the late 19th century.  During this period, the actual known corpus of Greek art, and to a lesser extent architecture, has greatly expanded.  The study of vases developed an enormous literature in the late 19th and 20th centuries, much based on the identification of the hands of individual artists, with Sir John Beazley the leading figure. This literature generally assumed that vase-painting represented the development of an independent medium, only in general terms drawing from stylistic development in other artistic media.  This assumption has been increasingly challenged in recent decades, and some scholars now see it as a secondary medium, largely representing cheap copies of now lost metalwork, and much of it made, not for ordinary use, but to deposit in burials.[150]\nSee also\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of a series on theHistory of Greek art\nGreek Bronze Age\nCycladic art\nMinoan art\nMycenaean art\nAncient Greece\nArchaic Greek art\nAncient Greek art\nAncient Greek architecture\nAncient Greek pottery\nAncient Greek sculpture\nHellenistic art\nsee also: Greco-Buddhist art\nMedieval Greece\nByzantine art\nMacedonian art\nPost-Byzantine Greece\nCretan School\nHeptanese School\nModern Greece\nModern Greek art\nModern Greek architecture\nMunich School\nContemporary Greek artvt\n\n\n\n\nAncient art history\nMiddle East\nMesopotamia\nAncient Egypt\nHittite\nPersia\nAsia\nIndia\nChina\nJapan\nKorea\nCambodia\nEuropean prehistory\nCycladic\nNuragic\nEtruscan\nCeltic\nScythia\nClassical art\nAncient Greece\nHellenistic\nRomevt\nDionysian art\nDeath in ancient Greek art\nParthian art\nList of ancient Greek temples\nNational Archaeological Museum of Athens\nClassical architecture\nNotes\n\n\n\"Beazley\" The Classical Art Research Centre, Oxford University.  \u2013 Extensive website on classical gems; page titles used as references\nBoardman, John ed., The Oxford History of Classical Art, Oxford University Press, 1993, ISBN0198143869\nBurnett, Andrew, Coins; Interpreting the Past, University of California\/British Museum, 1991, ISBN0520076281\nChamoux, Fran\u00e7ios, Hellenistic Civilization, translated by Michel Roussel, Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2002 [1981], ISBN0631222421.\nCohen, Ada, Art in the Era of Alexander the Great: Paradigms of Manhood and Their Cultural Traditions, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010, ISBN9780521769044\nCook, R.M., Greek Art, Penguin, 1986 (reprint of 1972), ISBN0140218661\nDunbabin, Katherine, M.

In the original trilogy, he is depicted as Emperor of the Galactic Empire and the Sith master of Darth Vader. In the prequel trilogy, he is portrayed as a charismatic Senator from Naboo who uses Machiavellian deception and political manipulation to rise to the position of Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic before transforming the Republic into the Empire.\nThough outwardly appearing to be a well-intentioned public servant and supporter of democracy prior to being Emperor,[5] Palpatine's true identity is actually Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith\u2014a cult of practitioners of the dark side of the Force previously thought to have been extinct for a millennium, and master of Darth Maul and Count Dooku.[5]  As his Sith identity, Palpatine masterminds the Clone Wars, using the conflict as a convenient pretext to grant himself dictatorial emergency powers and to stay in office long after his term has expired.\nPalpatine ultimately reorganizes the Republic into the Galactic Empire, declares martial law, and declares himself Emperor. Palpatine then all but exterminates the Jedi Order through Order 66. He also manipulates Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into turning to the dark side and serving as his new apprentice, Darth Vader. Palpatine rules the galaxy for over two decades before his reign is brought to an end in the Battle of Endor, when Vader turns on him and kills him in order to save his son, Luke Skywalker.\nSince the initial theatrical run of Return of the Jedi, Palpatine has become a widely recognized symbol of evil in popular culture, and since the prequel films, also one of sinister deception and the subversion of democracy.\nAppearances\n\nFilms\nOriginal trilogy\nThe Emperor is briefly mentioned in A New Hope (1977), the first film in the original trilogy. Grand Moff Tarkin explains to the fellow Imperials that the Emperor has dissolved the Senate.[6]\nThe Emperor first appears (in hologram form) in The Empire Strikes Back, the 1980 sequel to the original film, to address his Sith apprentice Darth Vader, informing him that Luke Skywalker has become a threat to the Empire. Vader persuades him that the young Jedi would be a great asset if he could be turned to the dark side of the Force.[7]\nIn 1983's Return of the Jedi, the Emperor appears in person to oversee the last stages of the second Death Star's construction. He assures Darth Vader that they will together turn Luke, Vader's son, to the dark side of the Force. Unknown to Vader, the Emperor plans to replace his apprentice with Luke. When Vader brings Luke before his master, the Emperor tempts Luke to join the dark side by appealing to the young Jedi's fear for his friends, whom he has lured into a trap. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader. The Emperor tells Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi. Enraged, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightning. Unable to bear the sight of his son in pain, Vader throws the Emperor into the Death Star\u2019s reactor, killing him.[8]\nPrequel trilogy\n\nIn the 1999 prequel Episode I: The Phantom Menace, which is set 32 years before A New Hope, Palpatine is depicted as a middle-aged Galactic Senator from the planet Naboo who is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. As Sidious, he advises the corrupt Trade Federation to blockade and invade Naboo. Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo flees to the planet Coruscant to receive counsel from Palpatine, unaware that he actually engineered the invasion. After a plea for help from the senate results in bureaucratic delays, Palpatine persuades Padm\u00e9 to call for a motion of no confidence against Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum.\nWhen Padm\u00e9 attempts to liberate Naboo, Sidious sends his Sith apprentice Darth Maul there to capture Padm\u00e9. The invasion is eventually thwarted and Maul is defeated in a lightsaber duel with Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. Palpatine uses the crisis to be elected the new Chancellor of the Republic. He then returns to Naboo, where he befriends the young Anakin Skywalker, telling the boy that, \"We will watch your career with great interest\".[9]\nIn the 2002 sequel Episode II: Attack of the Clones, set 10 years later, Palpatine exploits constitutional loopholes to remain in office even after the official expiration of his term. Meanwhile, as Sidious, he continues to manipulate events from behind the scenes by having his new Sith apprentice Count Dooku lead a movement of planets in seceding to form the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He then has the Separatists try to assassinate Padm\u00e9, now a senator, but the attempt on her life fails. He then arranges for Anakin to guard Padm\u00e9 on Naboo, which leads to them falling in love and marrying in secret.\nWith the Separatists secretly building a battle droid army, Palpatine uses the situation to have himself granted emergency powers. Palpatine feigns reluctance to accept this authority, promising to return it to the Senate once the crisis has ended. His first act is to allow a clone army's creation to counter the Separatist threat; this results in the first battle of the Clone Wars. With the galaxy now at war as Sidious planned, Dooku brings him the secret plans for an ultimate weapon.[10]\n\nIn the 2005 sequel Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, set three years later, Palpatine is captured by cyborg Separatist General Grievous, as part of a plan devised by Sidious. Palpatine is rescued by Anakin and Obi-Wan, but not before the Jedi confront Dooku again. A duel ensues in which Anakin defeats Dooku. Palpatine urges Anakin to kill the unarmed Dooku; after some hesitance, Anakin kills Dooku in cold blood. Palpatine then escapes with his Jedi rescuers and returns to Coruscant. By this point, Palpatine has become a virtual dictator, able to take any action in the Senate. He makes Anakin his personal representative on the Jedi Council, who deny Anakin the rank of Jedi Master and order him to spy on the Chancellor. Palpatine tells Anakin the story of Darth Plagueis, a powerful Sith Lord who was able to manipulate life and death but was killed by his own apprentice. Eventually, Palpatine reveals his secret Sith Lord identity to Anakin; he knows that Anakin has been having prophetic visions of Padm\u00e9 dying in childbirth, and offers to teach Plageuis' secrets to save Padme's life.\nAnakin informs Jedi Master Mace Windu of Palpatine's treachery. With three other Jedi masters at his side, Windu attempts to arrest Palpatine, but Palpatine produces a lightsaber from his sleeve and quickly dispatches all but Windu. Palpatine engages Windu in a duel and fires Force lightning at the Jedi Master, but Windu deflects the lightning back at its source, deforming Palpatine's face into the gray, wizened visage seen in the original trilogy. Just as Windu is about to dispatch Palpatine, Anakin appears and intervenes on the Sith Lord's behalf, allowing Palpatine to kill Windu with another blast of lightning, throwing Windu out of a window high above Coruscant. Anakin then pledges himself to the dark side as Palpatine's Sith apprentice, Darth Vader.\nPalpatine issues Order 66, commanding the clone troopers to turn on their Jedi generals, while dispatching Vader to kill everyone inside the Jedi Temple and then murder the Separatist leaders on the planet Mustafar. Palpatine then reorganizes the Republic into the Galactic Empire, with himself as Emperor. In Palpatine's office, Jedi Master Yoda confronts him  and engages the Sith Lord in a lightsaber duel that ends in a stalemate. Sensing that Vader is in danger, Palpatine travels to Mustafar and finds his new apprentice near death following a duel with Obi-Wan. After returning to Coruscant, he rebuilds Vader's burned, mutilated body with the black armored suit from the original trilogy. Palpatine then tells Vader that Padm\u00e9 was killed in the heat of Vader's anger, breaking what remains of his apprentice's spirit. Palpatine is last seen watching the original Death Star's construction, with Vader and Wilhuff Tarkin at his side.[11]\nSequel trilogy\nIn the first installment of the sequel trilogy, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Palpatine's voice can be heard during a vision that the character Rey experiences upon touching Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, which originally belonged to his father, Anakin.[12]\nIn Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Luke briefly mentions Palpatine as Darth Sidious while discussing the failure and fall of the Jedi Order to Rey.\nTelevision\nThe Clone Wars\nIn the 2008 animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars and the subsequent animated series (set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith), Palpatine continues to serve as Supreme Chancellor while his Sith identity remains behind the scenes via holograms. Palpatine was voiced by Ian Abercrombie (from 2008 to his death in 2012), and by Tim Curry (from 2012 to 2014).\nIn the film, Sidious engineers a Separatist plot where Count Dooku turns Jabba the Hutt against the Republic by kidnapping his son Rotta and framing the Jedi for it. Meanwhile, Palpatine suggests that the Republic ally itself with the Hutts. Although Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano foil the plot, the outcome suits Palpatine's ends: Jabba places Hutt hyperspace routes at the Republic's disposal.\nIn season two of the TV series, Sidious hires bounty hunter Cad Bane to infiltrate the Jedi Temple and steal a holocron. He then takes a valuable Kyber memory crystal that contains the names of thousands of Force-sensitive younglings - the future of the Jedi Order - from around the galaxy. The final stage of the plot: to bring four Force-sensitive children to Sidious' secret facility on Mustafar. Anakin and Ahsoka again foil the plot, but Bane escapes and all evidence of Sidious' involvement is lost.\nIn season three, Sidious senses Asajj Ventress becoming powerful in the dark side and orders Dooku to eliminate her; he suspects that Dookuy is planning to have Ventress assassinate him. Ventress survives and her revenge against Dooku sets off a chain of events including the return of Sidious' former apprentice and Dooku's predecessor, Darth Maul.\nIn season five, Sidious personally travels to the planet Mandalore to confront Maul after becoming leader of Death Watch, killing Savage Opress before torturing Maul with the intent to make use of his former apprentice.\nIn season six, Sidious goes to lengths to conceal his plan's full nature from the Jedi by silencing Clone Trooper Fives from learning of Order 66, and having Dooku wipe out anything tied to the former Jedi Master's connection to the conspiracy.\nRebels\nIn Star Wars Rebels, Palpatine remains the Emperor of the Galactic Empire.\nHe briefly appears offscreen at the end of season two's premiere \"The Siege of Lothal\" (voiced by Sam Witwer). Darth Vader informs Palpatine that the Rebel Alliance cell on Lothal has been broken. Vader also tells him that Ahsoka Tano is alive and is now helping the Rebels. Palpatine sees this as an opportunity to seek out other remaining Jedi (such as Obi-Wan). Palpatine then orders Vader to dispatch an Inquisitor to hunt down Ahsoka.\nPalpatine returns physically in season four (voiced again by Ian McDiarmid). In the episodes \"Wolves and a Door\" and \"A World Between Worlds\", he appears as a hologram overseeing the excavation of the Lothal Jedi Temple, which contains a portal to a separate dimension of the Force outside of space and time, which Palpatine considers a 'conduit between the living and the dead' that could give him unrivaled power of the Force itself if he can access it. Shortly after Ezra Bridger reaches through time and space to rescue Ahsoka from Vader, Palpatine sets up a portal that shows Kanan Jarrus' final moments. While Ezra wants to reach through the portal and rescue Kanan, Ahsoka convinces him not to. Palpatine then reveals himself through the portal and shoots Ezra with Force lightning. However, Ahsoka and Ezra manage to evade him and both go their separate ways, thus denying Palpatine full power.\nPalpatine later returns in the series finale \"Family Reunion - and Farewell\". In the episode, Ezra, having surrendered himself to Grand Admiral Thrawn to protect Lothal, is taken by him to a room containing a reconstructed section of the ruined Jedi Temple and a hologram of Palpatine's pre-disfigurement self. Palpatine, having acknowledged the threat Ezra faces to the Empire, presents himself as a kindly figure and shows Ezra a vision of his dead parents through a doorway, promising that the youth will be with them if he enters it. Ezra is initially mesmerized by Palpatine's promise and goes to enter the door, but finally resists and destroys the reconstructed Jedi Temple and the illusion. Palpatine's hologram emerges from the rubble, flickering to show his true self, and commands his Royal Guards to kill Ezra, though Ezra manages to defeat them and escape. According to series creator Dave Filoni, the events of Rogue One and A New Hope happen shortly after this episode, thus refocusing Palpatine's attention from Ezra and Lothal's liberation to the Rebel Alliance and Luke Skywalker.[13]\nBooks and comics\nThe first appearance of Palpatine in Star Wars literature was in Alan Dean Foster's (writing as George Lucas) novelization of the script of A New Hope, published as Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker (1976).[14][15]\nStar Wars: Lords of the Sith was subsequently announced as one of the first four canon novels to be released in 2014 and 2015.[16] In Lords of the Sith, Vader and Palpatine find themselves hunted by revolutionaries on the Twi'lek planet Ryloth.[17][18]\nPalpatine also appears frequently in the comic magazine Star Wars: Darth Vader, written by both Kieron Gillen and Charles Soule. It is revealed at the end of the series that Palpatine could have manipulated the Force to impregnate Shmi Skywalker with Anakin, technically making him his father, although the comic is somewhat vague about whether this is true.[19] This builds on the plot point of Anakin's virgin birth introduced in The Phantom Menace, and the indication that a Sith Lord \"could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life\" as Palpatine tells Anakin in Revenge of the Sith. In the rough draft of the latter film, Palpatine explicitly tells Anakin that he \"used the power of the Force to will the midichlorians to start the cell divisions\" that conceived him.[19]\nVideo games\nStar Wars Battlefront II adds a canonical tale spanning the destruction of the second Death Star through the events of The Force Awakens. The story takes an Imperial perspective, following an elite squadron known as Inferno Squad, led by protagonist Iden Versio, as they help to execute Operation Cinder following the Emperor\u2019s death. Operation: Cinder was carried out by the Galactic Empire as a means of devastating several Imperial planets a few weeks after the Battle of Endor. The operation was part of the \"Contingency\", a plan devised by Emperor Palpatine to ensure that the Empire and its enemies would not outlive him should he perish. The plan was put into action following the Emperor's death during the Battle of Endor.\nLegends\nIn April 2014, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise by Lucasfilm.[20][21][16] Star Wars Legends literature elaborates on Palpatine's role in Star Wars fiction outside of the films.\nTelevision\n\n\nPalpatine\/Darth Sidious is a central character in Genndy Tartakovsky's Star Wars: Clone Wars micro-series, which is set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The character's likeness in the series is based on that in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, and he is voiced by Nick Jameson. In the first chapter, Palpatine is informed by Obi-Wan Kenobi that the Jedi have discovered that the InterGalactic Banking Clan has established battle droid factories on the planet Muunilinst. Palpatine agrees to send a strike force that includes Anakin Skywalker, and suggests that Anakin be given \"special command\" of Obi-Wan's fighters. Yoda and Obi-Wan initially speak against the idea, but reluctantly concede.[22] In the seventh chapter, a holographic image of Sidious appears shortly after Dooku trains Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress. Sidious orders Ventress to track down and kill Anakin. He remarks to Dooku that Ventress is certain to be defeated, but that the point of her mission is to test Anakin.[23] In the final chapters, a hologram of Sidious again appears and orders General Grievous to begin an assault on the galactic capital.[24] Later, the Separatist invasion of Coruscant begins and Palpatine watches from his apartment in the 500 Republica. Grievous breaks through the Chancellor's window and attempts to kidnap him,[25] leading to a long chase while Palpatine is protected by Jedi Shaak Ti, Roron Corobb and Foul Moudama. After Grievous apprehends the Jedi, Palpatine is taken on board the Invisible Hand, setting the stage for Revenge of the Sith.[26]\nLiterature and comics\n\nPalpatine made his first major appearance in Legends in 1991 and 1992, with the Dark Empire series of comic books written by Tom Veitch and illustrated by Cam Kennedy. In the series (set six years after Return of the Jedi), Palpatine is resurrected as the Emperor Reborn or \"Palpatine the Undying\". His spirit returns from the netherworld of the Force with the aid of Sith ghosts on Korriban, the Sith world, and possesses the body of Jeng Droga, one of Palpatine's elite spies and assassins known as the Emperor's Hands. Droga flees to a secret Imperial base on the planet Byss, where the Emperor's advisor Sate Pestage exorcises Palpatine's spirit and channels it into one of many clones created by Palpatine before his death. Palpatine attempts to resume control of the galaxy, but Luke Skywalker, now a senior Jedi Knight, sabotages his plans. Luke destroys most of Palpatine's cloning tanks, but is only able to defeat the Emperor with help from Leia Organa Solo, who has received rudimentary Jedi training from Luke. The two repel a Force storm Palpatine had created and turn it back onto him, once again destroying his physical form.[27]\n\nPalpatine's ultimate fate is further chronicled in the Dark Empire II and Empire's End series of comics. The Dark Empire II series, published from 1994 to 1995, details how the Emperor is once again reborn on Byss into a clone body. Palpatine tries to rebuild the Empire as the Rebel Alliance grows weak.[28] In Empire's End (1995), a traitorous Imperial guard bribes Palpatine's cloning supervisor to tamper with the Emperor's stored DNA samples. This causes the clones to deteriorate at a rapid rate. Palpatine tries to possess the body of Anakin Solo, the infant son of Leia Organa and Han Solo, before the clone body dies, but is thwarted once again by Luke Skywalker. Palpatine is killed by a blaster shot fired by Han, but his spirit is captured by the mortally wounded Jedi Empatojayos Brand. When Brand dies, he takes Palpatine's spirit with him into the netherworld of the Force, destroying the Sith Lord once and for all.[29]\nNovels and comics published before 1999 focus on Palpatine's role as Galactic Emperor. Shadows of the Empire (1996) by Steve Perry and The Mandalorian Armor (1998) by K. W. Jeter\u2014all set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi\u2014show how Palpatine uses crime lords such as Prince Xizor and bounty hunters like Boba Fett to fight his enemies.[30][31] Barbara Hambly's novel Children of the Jedi (1995), set eight years after Return of the Jedi, features a woman named Roganda Ismaren who claims that Palpatine fathered her son Irek.[32] The Jedi Prince series of novels introduces an insane, three-eyed mutant named Triclops who is revealed to be Palpatine's illegitimate son.[33] Created from DNA extracted from Palpatine and placed into a woman, he was born mutated, cast away and forgotten. Triclops had a son named Ken who became known as the \"Jedi Prince\".\nBeginning in 1999 with Terry Brooks' novelization of The Phantom Menace, Star Wars writers chronicled the role of Palpatine prior to A New Hope as a politician and Sith Lord. The comic \"Marked\" by Rob Williams, printed in Star Wars Tales 24 (2005), and Michael Reaves' novel Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter (2001) explain Darth Sidious' relationship with his apprentice Darth Maul.[34][35] Cloak of Deception (2001) by James Luceno follows Reaves' novel and details how Darth Sidious encourages the Trade Federation to build an army of battle droids in preparation for the invasion of Naboo. Cloak of Deception also focuses on Palpatine's early political career, revealing how he becomes a confidante of Chancellor Finis Valorum and acquainted with Padm\u00e9 Amidala, newly elected queen of Naboo.[36] Palpatine's role during the Clone Wars as Chancellor of the Republic and Darth Sidious is portrayed in novels such as Matthew Stover's Shatterpoint (2003), Steven Barnes' The Cestus Deception (2004), Sean Stewart's Yoda: Dark Rendezvous (2004), and Luceno's Labyrinth of Evil (2005) and Darth Plagueis (2012).\nFollowing the theatrical release of Revenge of the Sith, Star Wars literature focused on Palpatine's role after the creation of the Empire. John Ostrander's comic Star Wars Republic 78: Loyalties (2005) chronicles how, shortly after seizing power, Emperor Palpatine sends Darth Vader to assassinate Sagoro Autem, an Imperial captain who plans to defect from the Empire.[37] In Luceno's novel Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (2005) (set shortly after Revenge of the Sith), the Emperor sends Darth Vader to the planet Murkhana to discover why clone troopers there refused to carry out Order 66 against their Jedi generals. Palpatine hopes these early missions will teach Vader what it means to be a Sith and crush any remnants of Anakin Skywalker.[38]\nCharacteristics\n\n\nIn Star Wars fiction, Palpatine is a cunning politician, a ruthless emperor, and an evil Sith Lord. The Star Wars Databank describes him as \"the supreme ruler of the most powerful tyrannical regime the galaxy had ever witnessed\"[39] and Stephen J. Sansweet's Star Wars Encyclopedia calls him \"evil incarnate\".[40]\nAs a senator, Palpatine is \"unassuming, yet ambitious\".[39] In Cloak of Deception, James Luceno writes that Palpatine carefully guards his privacy and \"others found his reclusiveness intriguing, as if he led a secret life\".[41] Despite this, he has many allies in the government. Luceno writes, \"What Palpatine lacked in charisma, he made up for in candor, and it was that directness that had led to his widespread appeal in the senate. ... For in his heart he judged the universe on his own terms, with a clear sense of right and wrong.\"[41] In Terry Brooks' novelization of The Phantom Menace, Palpatine claims to embrace democratic principles. He tells Queen Amidala, \"I promise, Your Majesty, if I am elected [chancellor of the Republic], I will restore democracy to the Republic. I will put an end to the corruption that has plagued the Senate.\"[42] A Visual Dictionary states that he is a self-proclaimed savior.[43]\nAs Emperor, however, Palpatine abandons any semblance of democracy, as noted in A New Hope, when he abolishes the Imperial Senate. Sansweet states, \"His Empire ... is based on tyranny.\"[40]\nRevenge of the Sith implies that Palpatine was the apprentice of Darth Plagueis, while later Expanded Universe materials say explicitly that he was.[44] Palpatine is characterized as \"the most powerful practitioner of the Sith ways in modern times.\"[45] Palpatine is so powerful that he is able to mask his true identity from the Jedi for decades. In the novel Shatterpoint, Mace Windu remarks to Yoda, \"A shame [Palpatine] can't touch the Force. He might have been a fine Jedi.\"[46]\nThe Star Wars Databank explains that the Force \"granted him inhuman dexterity and speed, agility enough to quickly kill three Jedi Masters\" (as depicted in Revenge of the Sith).[39] Stover describes the duel between Yoda and Palpatine in his novelization of Revenge of the Sith thus: \"From the shadow of a black wing, a small weapon... slid into a withered hand and spat a flame-colored blade[.] When the blades met it was more than Yoda against Palpatine, more the millennia of Sith against the legions of Jedi; this was the expression of the fundamental conflict of the universe itself. Light against dark. Winner take all.\"[47] During the duel, Yoda realizes that Sidious is a superior warrior, and represents a small but powerful Sith Order that had changed and evolved over the years, while the Jedi had not: \"He had lost before he started. He had lost before he was born.\"[48]\nAccording to the Databank and New Essential Guide to Characters, Palpatine possesses great patience and his maneuverings are as a dejarik grandmaster moves pieces on a board.[49] He is depicted as a diabolical genius.[50][51]\nPalpatine was not given a first name in any canonical or \"Star Wars Legends\" sources until 2014, when the character's first name\u2014Sheev\u2014was revealed in the novel Tarkin, written by James Luceno.[3] The Lucasfilm Story Group approached Del Rey Books and asked if they wanted to use the name, which was created by George Lucas, in the Tarkin novel, to which Del Rey agreed.[52]\nCharacter creation\nLucas' conceptualization of Palpatine and the role the character plays in Star Wars changed over time. From Return of the Jedi onwards, Palpatine became the ultimate personification of evil in Star Wars, replacing Darth Vader as the central villain.\nWhen the original Star Wars trilogy was filmed, the Emperor was unnamed and his throne-world unidentified. The name would not be used in film until the prequel trilogy, and the first mention of the name Palpatine came from the prologue of Alan Dean Foster's 1976 novelization of A New Hope, which detailed the Emperor's rise to power. Foster writes,\nAided and abetted by restless, power-hungry individuals within the government, and the massive organs of commerce, the ambitious Senator Palpatine caused himself to be elected President of the Republic. He promised to reunite the disaffected among the people and to restore the remembered glory of the Republic. Once secure in office he declared himself Emperor, shutting himself away from the populace. Soon he was controlled by the very assistants and boot-lickers he had appointed to high office, and the cries of the people for justice did not reach his ears.[14]\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether Lucas intended Palpatine to be the reigning Emperor or just the first of a succession of Emperors. Michael Kaminski, author of The Secret History of Star Wars, claims that Lucas' initial notes discuss a line of corrupt emperors, not just one. If Palpatine was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current.[53] Later Lucas would abandon this idea, opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler.\nDuring story conferences for The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas and Leigh Brackett decided that \"the Emperor and the Force had to be the two main concerns in the Empire Strikes Back; the Emperor had barely been dealt with in the first movie, and the intention in the sequel was to deal with him on a more concrete level.\"[54] Lucas ultimately decided instead to feature the Emperor in Return of the Jedi.\n\nIn that film, the initial conception of Palpatine was superseded by his depiction as a dictatorial ruler adept in the dark side of the Force. The Emperor was inspired by the villain Ming the Merciless from the Flash Gordon comic books.[55] The characterization of Palpatine as an ambitious and ruthless politician dismantling a democratic republic to achieve supreme power is in part inspired by the real-world examples of Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Adolf Hitler.[56][57] Other elements of the character come from Richard Nixon.[58][lower-alpha 2] Lucas said that Nixon's presidency \"got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships. Because the democracies aren't overthrown; they're given away.\"[60] Lucas also said, \"The whole point of the movies, the underlying element that makes the movies work, is that you, whether you go backwards or forwards, you start out in a democracy, and democracy turns into a dictatorship, and then the rebels make it back into a democracy.\"[61]\nLucas wanted to establish the Emperor as the true source of evil in Star Wars. Screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan noted, \"My sense of the relationship between Darth Vader and the Emperor is that the Emperor is much more powerful ... and that Vader is very much intimidated by him. Vader has dignity, but the Emperor in Jedi really has all the power.\"[62] He explained that the climax of the film is a confrontation between Darth Vader and his master. In the first scene that shows the Emperor, he arrives at the Death Star and is greeted by a host of stormtroopers, technicians, and other personnel. Lucas states he wanted it to look like the military parades on \"May Day in Russia.\"[63]\nLucas fleshed out the Emperor in the prequel films. According to Lucas, Palpatine's role in The Phantom Menace is to explain \"how Anakin Skywalker came to be Palpatine's apprentice\" and the events that lead to his rise to power.[64] The true identity of Darth Sidious \u2014 the phantom menace \u2014 is left a mystery, and his relationship to Palpatine is not clear, though popular consensus agreed that Darth Sidious and Palpatine were one and the same. Film critic Jonathan L. Bowen remarks, \"Debates raged on the Internet concerning the relationship between Darth Sidious and Senator Palpatine. Most fans believed the two characters are actually the same person with logic seeming to support their conclusion.\" Bowen notes that the debate was fueled by the fact that \"suspiciously Darth Sidious does not appear in the credits.\"[65]\n\nIn Star Wars and History published by Lucasfilm, it describes Palpatine's consolidation of power as being similar to the Roman political figure Augustus. Both legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in the Senate was hampering the powers of the head of state; both pressured the Senate to grant extraordinary powers to deal with a crisis, falsely claiming that they would rescind those powers once the crisis was over; and both relied on their strong control over military force.[66]\nPortrayal\nWhen the Emperor first appeared in The Empire Strikes Back, he was portrayed by Marjorie Eaton under heavy makeup.[67] Chimpanzee eyes were superimposed into darkened eye sockets during post-production \"in order to create a truly unsettling image\". The character was voiced by Clive Revill.[68] The makeup was sculpted by Phil Tippett and applied by Rick Baker,[2] who initially used his own wife, Elaine, for the makeup tests.[1][69]\n\"With [director Irvin] Kershner,\" Revill said, \"you had to keep the reins tight \u2014 you couldn't go overboard. It was the perfect example of the old adage 'less is more' \u2014 the Emperor doesn't say very much. But when he finally appears, it's at a point in the saga when everyone's waiting to see him. It's the Emperor, the arch villain of all time, and when he says there's a great disturbance in the Force, I mean, that's enough oomph!\"[70] Years later, during production of Revenge of the Sith, Lucas decided to shoot new footage for The Empire Strikes Back to create continuity between the prequels and original trilogy. Thus, in the 2004 DVD release of The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition, the original version of the Emperor was replaced by Scottish Shakespearean actor Ian McDiarmid, and the dialogue between the Emperor and Darth Vader was revised.[71]\nLucas and director Richard Marquand cast McDiarmid to play Emperor Palpatine for Return of the Jedi. He was in his late 30s and had never played a leading role in a feature film, though he had made minor appearances in films like Dragonslayer (1981). After Return of the Jedi, he resumed stage acting in London.[72] In an interview with BackStage, McDiarmid revealed that he \"never had his sights set on a film career and never even auditioned for the role of Palpatine.\" He elaborated, \"I got called in for the interview after a Return of the Jedi casting director saw me perform in the Sam Shepard play Seduced at a studio theatre at the Royal Court. I was playing a dying Howard Hughes.\"[73]\nMcDiarmid was surprised when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, \"When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them.\" McDiarmid added, \"Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It never occurred to me in a million years that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor to play Palpatine. That would be obvious.\" However, \"I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ... So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at my own age, having played myself previously when 100-and-I-don't-know-what.\"[74]\nPalpatine's role in the prequel films required McDiarmid to play two dimensions of the same character. Recalling the initial days of shooting The Phantom Menace, McDiarmid stated, \"Stepping onto the set of Episode I for the first time was like going back in time, due to my experience in Jedi. Palpatine's an interesting character; he's conventional on the outside, but demonic on the inside \u2014 he's on the edge, trying to go beyond what's possible.\"[75] McDiarmid added another layer to the character in Attack of the Clones. He noted, \"[Palpatine] is a supreme actor. He has to be even more convincing than somebody who isn't behaving in a schizophrenic fashion, so he's extra charming, or extra professional \u2014 and for those who are looking for clues, that's almost where you can see them.\" McDiarmid illuminated on the scene where Padm\u00e9 Amidala is almost assassinated:\nThere's a moment in one scene of the new film where tears almost appear in his eye. These are crocodile tears, but for all those in the movie, and perhaps watching the movie itself, they'll see he is apparently moved \u2014 and of course, he is. He can just do it. He can, as it were, turn it on. And I suppose for him, it's also a bit of a turn-on \u2014 the pure exercise of power is what he's all about. That's the only thing he's interested in and the only thing that can satisfy him \u2014 which makes him completely fascinating to play, because it is an evil soul. He is more evil than the devil. At least Satan fell \u2014 he has a history, and it's one of revenge.[76]\n\nIn Revenge of the Sith, McDiarmid played a darker interpretation of the character. He explained that \"[...] when you're playing a character of solid blackness, that in itself is very interesting, in the sense that you have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power.\" He admitted, \"I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera.\"[77] McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare's Othello:\nEverything he does is an act of pure hypocrisy, and that's interesting to play. I suppose it's rather like playing Iago. All the characters in the play \u2014 including Othello until the end \u2014 think that \"Honest Iago\" is a decent guy doing his job, and he's quite liked. But at the same time there's a tremendous evil subconscious in operation.[72]\n\nMcDiarmid noticed that the script for Revenge of the Sith demanded more action from his character than in previous films. Lightsaber combat was a challenge to the 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid.[78] Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid's doubles, Michael Byrne, Sebastian Dickins, and Bob Bowles.[79]\nMcDiarmid's performance as Palpatine was generally well received by critics. Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, \"Entertaining from start to finish and even enthralling at times, 'Sith' has some acting worth writing home about, specifically McDiarmid's dominant turn as the mastermind of the evil empire.\"[80]  Ed Halter of The Village Voice wrote that \"Ian McDiarmid's unctuous Emperor turns appropriately vampiric as he attempts to draw Anakin into the Sith fold with promises of eternal life.\"[81] Still, his performance was not without detractors; David Edelstein of Slate critiqued, \"McDiarmid isn't the subtlest of satanic tempters. With his lisp and his clammy little leer, he looks like an old queen keen on trading an aging butt-boy (Count Dooku) for fresh meat \u2014 which leaves Anakin looking more and more like a 15-watt bulb.\"[82] McDiarmid had expressed interest in reprising the role of Palpatine in the planned Star Wars: Underworld TV series,[83] which remains un-produced.\nMake-up and costumes\n\nIan McDiarmid required little make-up in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. He recalled, \"I'm ... slightly aged [in Attack of the Clones]. In the last film, I had a fairly standard make-up on, but now, they're starting to crinkle my face.\"[84] Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, however, required extensive make-up. McDiarmid remarked in an interview with Star Wars Insider magazine, \"Yes\u2014that was a four-hour job, initially, although we got it down to about two-and-a-half in the end. But this was just a little bit of latex here and there, a little bit of skin-scrunching.\"[84] He told the Homing Beacon newsletter, \"When my face changes in the film, my mind went back to the early silent movie of The Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney, Sr.\"[77] Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that he \"looks uncannily like Death in The Seventh Seal\" (1957)[85] and film historian Robin Wood compares him to the hag from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).[86]\nPalpatine's wardrobe, tailored by costume designer Trisha Biggar, played an important part in the development of the character throughout the films. In Attack of the Clones, explained McDiarmid, \"The costumes ... have got much more edge to them, I think, than the mere senator had in The Phantom Menace. So we see the trappings of power.\"[84] In the next episode, McDiarmid remarked, \"To wear the costumes as the character I play is wonderfully empowering.\"[87] McDiarmid's favorite costume in Revenge of the Sith was a high-collared jacket that resembles snake or lizard skin. He stated that \"it just feels reptilian, which is exactly right for [Palpatine].\" According to Trisha Biggar, Palpatine's costumes proved the most daunting challenge. She said, \"His six costumes get progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the movie. He wears greys and browns, almost going to black, taking him toward the dark side.\"[87]\nIn popular culture\n\nWith the premiere of Return of the Jedi and the prequel films and the accompanying merchandising campaign, Palpatine became an icon in American popular culture. Kenner\/Hasbro produced and marketed a series of action figures of the character from 1983 to 2005.[88] According to John Shelton Lawrence and Robert Jewett, \"These action figures allow children ('4 & up') to handle the symbols of the Force.\"[89]\nAcademics have debated the relationship of Palpatine to modern culture. Religion scholars Ross Shepard Kraemer, William Cassidy, and Susan Schwartz compare Palpatine and Star Wars heroes to the theological concept of dualism. They insist, \"One can certainly picture the evil emperor in Star Wars as Satan, complete with his infernal powers, leading his faceless minions such as his red-robed Imperial Guards.\"[90] Lawrence and Jewett argue that Vader killing Palpatine in Return of the Jedi represented \"the permanent subduing of evil\".\nSince Return of the Jedi and the prequel films, Palpatine's name has been invoked as a caricature in politics. A Seattle Post-Intelligencer editorial noted that anti-pork bloggers were caricaturing West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd as \"the Emperor Palpatine of pork\", with Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska having \"clear aspirations to be his Darth Vader.\" The charge followed a report that linked a secret hold on the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to the two senators.[91] Politicians have made comparisons as well. In 2005, Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey compared Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee to Palpatine in a speech on the Senate floor, complete with a visual aid.[92]\nA Fox News editorial stated \"no cultural icon can exist without someone trying to stuff it into a political ideology. The Star Wars saga, the greatest pop culture icon of the last three decades, is no exception... Palpatine's dissolution of the Senate in favor of imperial rule has been compared to Julius Caesar's marginalization of the Roman Senate, Hitler's power-grab as chancellor, and FDR's court-packing scheme and creation of the imperial presidency.\"[93]\n\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\nWorks cited\n\nFurther reading\n\nAnderson, Kevin J., and Daniel Wallace.

{"question":"When did the case of R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport  take place?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[5832,12934,2056],"passage_indices":[6,15,3],"start_positions":[5819,12922,2052],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","NONE","NONE"]},"context":["Main Page\nR (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport[1] was a judicial review case taken against the United Kingdom government by a company of Spanish fishermen who claimed that the United Kingdom had breached European Union law by requiring ships to have a majority of British owners if they were to be registered in the UK. The case produced a number of significant judgments on British constitutional law, and was the first time that courts held that they had power to restrain the application of an Act of Parliament pending trial and ultimately to disapply that Act when it was found to be contrary to EU law.\nThe litigation was lengthy, and is typically divided into five main stages:\nFactortame I, where the High Court and then the House of Lords both made a reference to the European Court of Justice on the legality of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988's (\"MSA\") requirement for UK fishing vessels to be 75% UK owned. After the ECJ confirmed the incompatibility of the Act with EU law, Factortame saw the House of Lords confirm the supremacy of EU law over national law in the areas where the EU has competence because of the UK acceding to the EU treaties.[2]\nFactortame II, where the ECJ held that the provisions of the MSA were required to be disapplied by the UK courts if they contravened EU law.\nFactortame III, where the ECJ held that a member state could be liable for damages in an action by the European Commission for breach of EU law.\nFactortame IV, where the House of Lords ruled that damages could be awarded against a member state like the UK for losses suffered by private parties under the Francovich v Italy[3] principle, that wrongs by violation of a public body generate a private law claim from anybody who has suffered a directly connected loss (also known as the doctrine of state liability).\nFactortame V, holding that claims after 1996 were statute-barred, since claims against a member state were like other claims in tort under the Limitation Act 1980.\nFacts\nThe EU's Common Fisheries Policy, which began in 1970, aimed at creating a common market for fisheries products by providing for free access to the waters of all member states and introducing structural funds to ensure modernisation of the sector.[4] In 1976 it was agreed that, as from 1 January the following year, member states would extend their exclusive economic zone, which included the limit of their fishing zones, to a distance 200 nautical miles (370km) from their coastlines. In 1980 the EU concluded a fisheries agreement with Spain, which did not become a member of the EU until 1985,[5] which gave the latter (which had the largest fishing fleet in Europe) limited rights to fish in the waters of the member states. In 1983 concerns over the effect that equality of access might have on fishing stocks led to the introduction of certain controls, notably the concept of \"total allowable catches\" which set maximum quotas of fish which could be caught by each member state, and the British Fishing Boats Act 1983 (BFBA).[5] In 1985, with Spanish accession, everything changed and the BFBA no longer applied to the Spanish fishermen.[5]\nFrom 1980, as seen earlier, Galician fishermen began to enter the UK fishing market by taking advantage of easy fishing vessel registration requirements contained in the Merchant Shipping Act 1894.  Although the 1894 Act prohibited ownership of vessels by non-UK nationals, UK-domiciled companies were allowed registration as the owners. Amongst the early beneficiaries of the 1894 Act was Factortame Limited, a company whose directors were Joseph J L Couceiro, John A Couceiro and Ken L Couceiro, all British nationals with Spanish ancestry resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The company, together with 96 others[6] whose directors and shareholders were mostly Spanish nationals, re-registered 53 vessels which had formerly flown the Spanish flag as British fishing vessels under the 1894 Act. They also acquired 42 existing British vessels with a view to using them in the fishing zone. Most of these vessels landed their catches in Spain, but as the fish were caught in UK waters, they counted against the UK fishing quota, a practice known as \"quota hopping\".\nIn order to put an end to this practice, the British Government enacted a series of measures which proved largely ineffective. In two cases the High Court of Justice of England and Wales asked preliminary questions to ECJ; based on which both cases were lost by HMG - see Agegate (C-3\/87, ) and Jaderow (C-216\/87, ).[5] In 1988 the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 and the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Fishing Vessels) Regulations were introduced as a result, to replace the system of registration contained in the 1894 Act with a new system under which a vessel could only be registered if it had \"a genuine and substantial connection\" with the UK. For this to be the case, three conditions had to be fulfilled: (i) the vessel must be British-owned; (ii) the vessel had to be managed and its operations had to be directed and controlled from the UK; and (iii) any charterer, manager or operator had to be a qualified person or company. A \"qualified person or company\" was a person who was a British citizen resident and domiciled in the UK or a company which was incorporated in the UK and had its principal place of business there having at least 75% of its shares owned by, and at least 75% of its directors being, \"qualified persons\".\nAs from 31 March 1989, fishing vessel registrations under the 1894 Act would lapse and the owners would be required to re-register under the 1988 Act. None of Factortame's vessels could satisfy the new requirements and an action for judicial review was brought by its owners in the Divisional Court of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in December 1988.\nFactortame I\nFactortame Ltd sought, first, a preliminary injunction declaring that the offending part of the 1988 Act could not be applied to them on the grounds that such application would be contrary to directly effective rights under EU law, specifically the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality (article 7 of the Treaty of Rome), the right of individuals and companies to establish themselves in business anywhere in the EU (articles 43\u201348), and the right to participate in the capital of companies situated in another Member State (article 294). The claimants also demanded an order of prohibition preventing the Secretary of State from treating its registrations under the 1894 Act as having ceased.\nHMG argued that the registration requirements were intended to ensure that fishing vessels flying the British flag had a genuine link with the UK. It maintained that international law entitled each State to determine the conditions under which a ship might fly its flag and that Community law had not removed that right. It was also contended that the 1988 Act was consistent with the Community policy on fisheries.  In the event this assertion proved false.\nHigh Court\nOn 10 March 1989 the Divisional Court (Neill LJ and Hodgson J) referred the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 of the Treaty of Rome (case C-221\/89). It asked whether requirements as to nationality, domicile and control imposed by a Member State as conditions for the registration of fishing vessels were compatible with Community law (now: European Union law). At the same time, the Court granted an injunction against the application of the 1988 Act pending a ruling by the ECJ. Giving his judgment, Lord Justice Neill stated that although Community law is part of English law and prevails in the event of a conflict, it was open to argument whether a conflict existed in this case; a national court would have to take a decision which preserves the status quo ante. HMG disapproved and elevated the case to the Court of Appeal.\nCourt of Appeal\nThe Court of Appeal (Lord Donaldson MR, Bingham LJ and Mann LJ) reversed the Divisional Court's decision on 22 March 1989 on the basis that, although a national court was obliged to give effect to Community law, it was not obliged \"to override national law in favour of what is no more than an alleged or putative Community right\". Furthermore, it did not believe that the Divisional Court had \"acknowledged the constitutional enormity, as the law stands, of requiring a Secretary of State to act contrary to the clearly expressed will of Parliament when the unlawfulness of that expression has yet to be established\". The Divisional Court would not, according to the court, have jurisdiction to grant an injunction until Factortame had succeeded before the ECJ.\nHouse of Lords\nThe case was brought on 18 May 1989 by Factortame before the House of Lords (Lord Bridge, Lord Brandon, Lord Oliver, Lord Goff and Lord Jauncey) who upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal on the grounds that English law did not contain any rule allowing a preliminary injunction against the application of an Act of Parliament. According to Lord Bridge, two obstacles stood in the way of the granting of the injunction. Firstly, the relief sought required the court to order positive action in the shape of the disapplication of the 1988 Act and the application of the 1894 Act; were Factortame not to succeed before the ECJ, the House of Lords would have \"conferred upon them rights directly contrary to Parliament's sovereign will\". Secondly, the court had no jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction against the Crown.\nNevertheless, Lord Bridge did accept that each of these obstacles was subject to any contrary Community law requirement. This required the House of Lords to determine whether, regardless of the position in national law, there existed an overriding principle of Community law imposing an obligation on a national court, faced with a seriously arguable claim to rights having direct effect under Community law, to grant interim relief. Lord Bridge concluded that as there was no clear authority on this question, a decision from the ECJ was necessary to enable the House of Lords to give judgment. The House was, in any event, obliged to request a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU post-Lisbon Treaty) which obliges courts \"against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law\" to make a reference. This request for a preliminary ruling was in addition to that already made by the Divisional Court on the compatibility of the 1988 Act with Community law.\nEuropean Court of Justice\nThe action was lodged at the ECJ on 10 July 1989 (as Case C-213\/89) by the House of Lords with the request that it deal with the matter quickly, which it indeed did, giving the case priority over others. The whole matter had up until then proceeded with great speed, taking only 6 months from its commencement before the Divisional Court to the House of Lords' judgment. The questions posed essentially asked whether, in the circumstances of the case, Community law overrode English law and either empowered or obliged UK courts to grant the injunction claimed by Factortame.\nAdvocate-General Tesauro argued his opinion on 17 May 1990 (). He first noted that the injunction sought by Factortame would in fact be available in all Member States except the UK and Denmark. He then proceeded to conclude that a national court must have the power to provisionally set aside a national law which conflicts with Community law, founding his argument on three bases. He recalled that it had been established in Simmenthal (case 106\/77) that directly effective Community law provisions create legal rights which are enforceable by individuals from the date of their entry into force, regardless of any contrary national law. It also followed from the ECJ's case law that it was for the legal system of each Member State to designate the procedures intended to protect Community law rights, and that these procedures must not \"be adapted so as it make it impossible in practice to exercise the rights which the national courts are required to protect\" (case 61\/79, Denkavit, ). National courts must, in that respect, apply EC law through available national procedures or, failing that, of their own motion. Focusing on the House of Lords' argument that it could not temporarily suspend the application of a national law, the Advocate-General emphasised the importance of interim relief in every legal system, remarking that its purpose was to ensure that the time needed to establish a right would not deprive that right of any substance. Furthermore, he did not believe that national courts were entitled to give priority to national legislation merely because it had not yet been shown to be incompatible with Community law; if that were the case, rights conferred by national law would have greater protection than that offered to Community law rights.\nOn 19 June 1990 the ECJ court (as \"full court\" of 11 justices) en banc gave its ruling,[7] rephrasing the question posed as \"whether a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule\". Following the Advocate-General's opinion, the ECJ held that a national court, in fact, has a duty to grant interim relief to safeguard alleged Community rights of individuals until the decision of the ECJ on the interpretation of Community law is available, and where a rule of national law would deny such relief, to set aside that rule. The basis of such a duty lies in the nature and object of directly effective Community law rights which are intended to be fully effective throughout the EU, and where, in order to safeguard such a right, it is necessary to grant interim measures, a national court must do so. This is especially true where a national court is awaiting a clarification or interpretation of the right claimed by the ECJ.\nBack to the House of Lords\nOn 11 October 1990 the House of Lords gave its judgment in the light of the ECJ's ruling and granted an injunction in favour of Factortame. Three principal issues emerged from their judgment, namely the availability of interim relief against the Crown, the basis on which such relief can be granted, and the impact of the ruling on Parliamentary sovereignty. Lord Goff acknowledged that, as a matter of Community law, interim relief had to be available in principle against the Crown, and the basis for granting it lay in section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (now titled the Senior Courts Act 1981).\nIn deciding to grant relief to Factortame, two factors influenced the House of Lords. Firstly, the likelihood that Factortame would suffer hardship and loss, were relief not to be allowed. Secondly, the prospects of Factortame succeeding in a full trial of the case once the ECJ had given its ruling on the compatibility of the 1988 Act; in this regard, the House of Lords took into account indications from the ECJ's first ruling that Factortame's arguments had \"considerable force\". Lord Goff did, however, emphasise that the courts would not, in other cases, readily or easily grant an injunction against the Crown which effectively prevents the Crown from applying national law.\nAddressing the public criticism expressed following the ECJ's decision and the alleged erosion of Parliamentary sovereignty, Lord Bridge remarked that such comments were \"based on a misconception\", and that under the European Communities Act 1972, the law regulating the UK's membership of the EU, it had \"always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law\". In the same way that Parliament had introduced legislation to remedy areas of UK law which did not meet the standards set by EU directives, the House of Lords was now accomplishing the same task in giving judgment for Factortame. There was nothing new, in this respect, in recognising the supremacy of EU law in the areas in which it applies.\nThese comments[8] were perceived by Sir William Wade as \"revolutionary\",[9] in that Lord Bridge suggests that Parliament has, in passing the European Communities Act 1972, managed to bind its successors from repealing the Act impliedly. It had previously been thought that no parliament could ever bind its successors in such a way. In a case where two statutes conflicted, the traditional approach would have been to apply the later statute on the basis that the inconsistent parts of the earlier statute had been repealed.\nSuch an interpretation of the case is supported by statements in Thoburn v Sunderland City Council and Hunt v Hackney Borough Council to the effect that there now exist two forms of Acts of Parliament: ordinary acts which can be repealed impliedly, and \"statutory\" or \"constitutional\" acts which can only be repealed expressly. (See in particular the judgment of Laws LJ in Thoburn.) Nevertheless, there is no restriction on the ability of Parliament to expressly repeal the European Communities Act 1972.\nFurthermore, the case does not, on a strict reading, constitute a breach of parliamentary sovereignty. The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was not a purposeful and direct conflict with EC law, but was instead an attempt to give effect to the fishing quotas required under EC law. Therefore, the courts were not striking down a domestic Act of Parliament, but were instead attempting to interpret legislation in a manner compatible with the Treaty obligations that arise under the European Communities Act 1972 (as proposed by Lord Diplock in the case of Garland v British Rail Engineering). It remains to be seen how the courts would respond to an Act of Parliament intentionally contradicting EC law. However, in the case of Macarthys v Smith, Lord Denning suggested that, should such an event occur, the courts would be obliged to obey the domestic law over the European.\nFactortame II compatibility\nOn 25 July 1991 the ECJ gave its ruling in case C-221\/89 on the question referred by the High Court,[10] namely whether the conditions for registration of fishing vessels under the 1988 Act were compatible with Community law. Agreeing with Advocate-General Mischo's opinion, the court (sitting as the full court of 11 justices) en banc held that \"it is for the Member States to determine ... the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for a vessel to be registered in their registers and granted the right to fly their flag, but, in exercising that power, the Member States must comply with the rules of Community law\". In particular, the conditions for registration should not constitute obstacles for nationals of one Member State to establish themselves in business in the territory of another Member State (the freedom of establishment), nor should they discriminate on the basis of nationality.\nIn the event, the ECJ found the nationality requirements in the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 discriminatory and contrary to Article 43 EC as a restriction on the freedom of establishment. It also violated articles 12 and 221 EC. The residence and domicile conditions also breached Article 43. In effect, by introducing a requirement based on an individual's residence and domicile, the Act operated an unfair distinction between UK nationals and those from other Member States as \"the great majority of nationals of the [UK] are resident and domiciled in that State and therefore meet that requirement automatically, whereas nationals of other Member States would, in most cases, have to move their residence and domicile to [the UK] in order to comply with the requirements of [the 1988 Act]\". In respect of the condition that the vessel should be managed and its operations directed from the UK, the ECJ found, however, that this requirement was compatible with Community law.\nThe UK government had argued that the conditions imposed by the 1988 Act were justified on the basis that the Common Fisheries Policy allowed for a system of national quotas and the 1988 Act ensured the effectiveness of that system. This was rejected by the ECJ which stated that fishing vessel registration criteria were permitted, but not where they violated Community law. It was, in that respect, open to the UK government to introduce conditions ensuring that a \"real economic link\" existed between the ship and the State of registration, but such a link had to \"concern only the relations between the vessel's operations and the population dependent on fisheries and related industries\". In other words, it would have been possible for the UK government to prescribe conditions which protected UK fishing communities from the effects of the opening up of national fishing waters to other Member States, but it could not do that through the imposition of explicit nationality and residence conditions.\nFactortame III state liability\n\nFollowing the ECJ's second ruling, the case returned once more to the High Court which, on 18 November 1992, requested a third ruling from ECJ concerning the conditions under which a member state may incur liability for damage caused to individuals by breaches of Community law attributable to that state. At around the same time the German Federal Court had asked for a ruling on a similar question in the case of Brasserie du P\u00eacheur v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and so the two cases (C46\/93 and C48\/93) were joined.\nAt this time the ECJ had just delivered judgment in Francovich (), which established the principle that \"a State must be liable for loss and damage caused to individuals as a result of breaches of Community law\". The Factortame case provided the court for an opportunity to elaborate on the principles underlying the liability of member states. It was a case in which almost all member states intervened to deny, whether wholly or substantially, the right to claim damages; the UK accepted that there was, in principle, such a right. The EC Treaty does not deal expressly with the consequences of a breach of Community law by a member state, and so it was for the court to rule on the question having regard to \"the fundamental principles of the Community legal system and, where necessary, general principles common to the legal systems of the Member States\".\nIn its judgment delivered on 5 March 1996,[11] the court of nine justices en banc reaffirmed the right of reparation, and stated that it existed irrespective of whether the provision of Community law in question has direct effect. Furthermore, the principle applies to any case where a member state breaches Community law, irrespective of which organ of the state was responsible for the breach. The ECJ rejected the contentions that the right to reparation required the introduction of legislation by the EU, and that the availability of damages should be decided, in each case, on the basis of the national law of the state in question.\nThe court proceeded to outline the conditions on which liability would be established. It underlined that such conditions could not, in the absence of a particular justification, differ from the conditions applicable to the liability of the Community in similar circumstances. Further, the right to reparation would depend on the nature of the breach of Community law in question and the extent of the discretion available to the State in question. The conditions are:\nthe rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals;\nthe breach must be sufficiently serious;\nthere must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation and the damage sustained by the injured party.\nIn the case where a state had exercised broad discretion in passing legislation which breached Community law (as was the case in Factortame), for the breach to be \"sufficiently serious\" it must be \"manifest\" and \"grave\". National courts have jurisdiction to decide how to characterise the breach in question, taking into account the clarity and precision of the Community rule infringed, whether the damage was intentional or involuntary, whether any error of law was excusable, and whether a Community institution contributed towards the adoption or maintenance of contrary national measures or practices. These same conditions apply to state liability for damage caused by the decision of a judicial body adjudicating at last instance.\nFactortame IV right to damages\nThe matter came back to the Divisional Court (Hobhouse LJ, Collins J and Moses LJ) which ruled on 31 July 1997 that HMG had committed a sufficiently serious breach of Community law in passing the offending provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, and that that breach gave rise to damage for which Factortame should be compensated. The court rejected a claim by Factortame for exemplary damages. The decision was appealed by HMG to the Court of Appeal (Lord Woolf MR, Schiemann LJ and Walker LJ) which rejected the appeal on 8 April 1998.[12] HMG appealed again to the House of Lords (Lord Slynn, Lord Nicholls, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Clyde and Lord Hope).\nThe House of Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Factortame on 28 October 1999. It rejected the argument that HMG's reliance on legal advice at the time of passing the 1988 Act did not deprive the breach of its grave and manifest character. The court did accept, however, that the government had acted in good faith in passing the Act. Nevertheless, the government had been aware of the risk it was running with such legislation and it had done everything possible to ensure that fishermen could not obtain interim relief against the Act's application. The case would now go back to the Divisional Court for the amount of damages to be determined.\nIn March 2000, Factortame and the other claimants (approximately 90 Anglo-Spanish fishing companies) accepted an offer of settlement from the Secretary of State. Under the terms of the settlement the claimants, who had originally claimed \u00a3285 million, received \u00a355 million including interest of some \u00a326 million.[13]\nFactortame V limitation issues\nOn 27 November 2000, Judge Toulmin in the Technology and Construction Court (a division of the High Court) held, under the Limitation Act 1980, Factortame's claims against the UK government were \"actions founded on tort\", and that consequently a six-year limitation period applied. This meant that other claims against the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 would only be admissible if they had been lodged by 10 July 1996 (i.e. six years from the House of Lords' decision of 9 July 1990 granting Factortame interim relief), otherwise such claims were statute-barred. The judge therefore rejected claims by Factortame in respect of other fishing vessels which had been refused registration under the 1988 Act, but which had not formed part of the original claim lodged in 1988, nor had been claimed before July 1996.\nThe judge also rejected an attempt by Factortame to obtain damages for injury to feelings and aggravated damages caused by HMG's breach of Community law. Factortame had argued that claims for discrimination under European law were broadly comparable to claims for discrimination to individuals under the Race Relations Act 1976. This was not accepted by Judge Toulmin who emphasised that such damages were only awarded in cases where the breach in question had caused harm to the claimant's self-esteem.\nSignificance\nThe Factortame case has produced large amounts of academic debate as to whether it can be reconciled with the idea of legislative supremacy as stated by Dicey. Sir William Wade argues that the Factortame judgment alters the Rule of Recognition.[14]\nThe issue of whether the UK Parliament or the European Court of Justice has ultimate sovereignty over European Community laws which apply to the UK is still an area of intense legal debate and conflicting views. In current practice, the UK recognises the primacy of the European Court of Justice for those areas of law in which the EU has competency. However, in Macarthys Ltd v Smith, Lord Denning MR said, \"If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act\u2014with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it\u2014or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it\u2014and says so in express terms\u2014then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament.\"[15][16]\nThis view of the UK's ultimate sovereignty was supported by Lord Justice Laws in the Thoburn v Sunderland City Council case, when he said that \"there is nothing in the European Communities Act which allows the European Court, or any other institution of the EU, to touch or qualify the conditions of Parliament's legislative supremacy in the United Kingdom ... That being so, the legislative and judicial institutions of the EU cannot intrude upon those conditions.\"\nThat European law has primacy over UK law has been stated many times in European courts. In ECJ Case 6\/64 Costa v ENEL (1964), the ECJ stated that \"the Members States have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields\". In Case 26\/62 Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen (1963) their ruling states that \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights\".\nThe question of who has the ultimate kompetenz-kompetenz (i.e. the right to decide the limits the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction) has not been settled.\nSee also\nEuropean Union law\n1993 Cherbourg incident\nSupremacy (European Union law), and the Solange doctrine of German law\nConstitution of the United Kingdom\nHistory of the British constitution\nPescanova\nNotes\n\n\nArticles\n\nBooks\nA O'Neill, EU Law for UK Lawyers (Hart 2011) 279-286\nP Craig and G de B\u00farca, EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials (5th edn OUP 2011) 287-288\n\n\nFactortame I\nHigh Court judgment, 10 March 1989\nCourt of Appeal judgment, 22 March 1989\n\n\n\n\nFactortame II\n\nFactortame III\n\nFactortame IV\n\nFactortame V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"01ffe15b-e0d8-4179-beb0-f051d62a5076"}
{"question":"Does the Magellanic Cloud system have a super massive black hole?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"passage_indices":[-1,-1,-1],"start_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","NONE","NONE"]},"context":["\n\nThe Magellanic Clouds (or Nubeculae Magellani[2]) are two irregular dwarf galaxies visible in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere; they are members of the Local Group and are orbiting the Milky Way galaxy. Because both show signs of a bar structure, they are often reclassified as Magellanic spiral galaxies.\nThe two galaxies are:\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC), approximately 160,000 light-years away\nSmall Magellanic Cloud (SMC), approximately 200,000 light years away\nHistory\nProbably the oldest continuous extant references to the clouds come from the Khoisan culture of Southern Africa, who migrated into Southern Africa 150,000 years ago, possibly as early as 260,000 years ago.[3][4]\nAnother long history of cultural association may have re-emerged with the migration of humans south from the Middle East reaching Australia approximately 50\u201360 thousand years ago. Those people were the ancestors of the Aboriginal Australians, whose various cultures have a variety of stories about these galaxies.[5]\nThe Magellanic Clouds were known to the Polynesians and served as important navigation markers. Collectively they were known to M\u0101ori of New Zealand as Ng\u0101 P\u0101tari[6] or as Te Reporepo and were thought to be predictors of winds.\nThe Magellanic Clouds have been known since the first millennium in Western Asia. The first preserved mention of the Large Magellanic Cloud is by the Muslim polymath Ibn Qutaybah (d. 889 CE), in his book on Al-Anwaa (stations of the Moon in pre-Islamic Arabian culture): \"\u0648\u0623\u0633\u0641\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0647\u064a\u0644 \u0642\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0633\u0647\u064a\u0644 . \u0648\u0641\u0649 \u0645\u062c\u0631\u0649 \u0642\u062f\u0645\u0649 \u0633\u0647\u064a\u0644\u060c \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0641\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0648\u0627\u0643\u0628 \u0632\u0647\u0631 \u0643\u0628\u0627\u0631\u060c \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0649 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642\u060c \u064a\u0633\u0645\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0647\u0644 \u062a\u0647\u0627\u0645\u0629  \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631 And below Canopus, there are the feet of Canopus, and on their extension, behind them bright big stars, not seen in Iraq, the people of Tihama call them al-a`baar.\"[7] Later Al Sufi, also a Muslim, and a professional astronomer,[8] in 964 CE, in his Book of Fixed Stars, mentioned the same quote, but with a different spelling. Under Argo Navis, he quoted that \"unnamed others have claimed that beneath Canopus there are two stars known as the 'feet of Canopus', and beneath those there are bright white stars that are unseen in Iraq nor Najd, and that the inhabitants of Tihama call them al-Baqar [cows], and Ptolemy did not mention any of this so we [Al-Sufi] do not know if this is true or false.\".[9] Both Ibn Qutaybah and Al-Sufi were probably quoting from the former's contemporary (and compatriot) and famed scientist Abu Hanifa Dinawari's mostly lost work on Anwaa. Abu Hanifa was probably quoting earlier sources, which may be just travelers stories, and hence Al-Sufi's comments about their veracity.\nIn Sri Lanka, from ancient times, these clouds have been referred to as the Maha Mera Paruwathaya meaning \"the great mountain\", as they look like the peaks of a distant mountain range.\nIn Europe, the Clouds were first reported by 16th century Italian authors Peter Martyr d'Anghiera and Andrea Corsali, both based on Portuguese voyages.[10][11] Subsequently, they were reported by Antonio Pigafetta, who accompanied the expedition of Ferdinand Magellan on its circumnavigation of the world in 1519\u20131522.[12][2] However, naming the clouds after Magellan did not become widespread until much later. In Bayer's Uranometria they are designated as nubecula major and nubecula minor.[13] In the 1756 star map of the French astronomer Lacaille, they are designated as le Grand Nuage and le Petit Nuage (\"the Large Cloud\" and \"the Small Cloud\").[14] Herschel in 1847 from Cape Observatory South Africa spent 4 years writing a 400-page report detailing over a thousand of the many stars, nebulae and clusters which constitute the cloud which appeared to be a separate more distant group to the usual stars in the Milky Way, an early indication of separate galaxy.\nCharacteristics\n\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud and its neighbour and relative, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are conspicuous objects in the southern hemisphere, looking like separated pieces of the Milky Way to the naked eye. Roughly 21\u00b0 apart in the night sky, the true distance between them is roughly 75,000 light-years. Until the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy in 1994, they were the closest known galaxies to our own (since 2003, the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy was discovered to be closer still, and is now considered the actual nearest neighbor). The LMC lies about 160,000 light years away,[15][16][17][18] while the SMC is around 200,000.[19] The LMC is about twice the diameter of the SMC (14,000 ly and 7,000 ly respectively). For comparison, the Milky Way is about 100,000 ly across.\nThe total mass of these two galaxies is uncertain. Only a fraction of their gas seems to have coalesced into stars and they probably both have large dark matter halos. One recent estimate of the total mass of the LMC is about 1\/10 that of the Milky Way. That would make the LMC rather a large galaxy in the current observable universe. Since the size of relatively nearby galaxies are highly skewed, the average mass can be a misleading statistic. In terms of rank, the LMC appears to be the fourth most massive member of over 50 galaxies in the local group. Suggesting that the Magellanic cloud system is historically not a part of the Milky Way is evidence that the SMC has been in orbit about the LMC for a very long time. The Magellanic system seems most similar to the distinct NGC 3109 system, which is on the edge of the Local Group.\nAstronomers have long assumed that the Magellanic Clouds have orbited the Milky Way at approximately their current distances, but evidence suggests that it is rare for them to come as close to the Milky Way as they are now.[20] Observation and theoretical evidence suggest that the Magellanic Clouds have both been greatly distorted by tidal interaction with the Milky Way as they travel close to it. The LMC maintains a very clear spiral structure in radio-telescope images of neutral hydrogen. Streams of neutral hydrogen connect them to the Milky Way and to each other, and both resemble disrupted barred spiral galaxies.[21] Their gravity has affected the Milky Way as well, distorting the outer parts of the galactic disk.\nAside from their different structure and lower mass, they differ from our galaxy in two major ways. First, they are gas-rich; a higher fraction of their mass is hydrogen and helium compared to the Milky Way.[22] They are also more metal-poor than the Milky Way; the youngest stars in the LMC and SMC have a metallicity of 0.5 and 0.25 times solar, respectively.[23]  Both are noted for their nebulae and young stellar populations, but as in our own galaxy their stars range from the very young to the very old, indicating a long stellar formation history.[24]\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud was host galaxy to a supernova (SN 1987A), the brightest observed in over four centuries.\nMeasurements with the Hubble Space Telescope, announced in 2006, suggest the Magellanic Clouds may be moving too fast to be long term companions of the Milky Way.[25]  If they are in orbit, that orbit takes at least 4 billion years. They are possibly on a first approach and we are witnessing the start of a galactic merger that may overlap with the Milky Way's expected merger with the Andromeda Galaxy (and perhaps the Triangulum Galaxy) in the future.\nMini Magellanic Cloud (MMC)\nAstrophysicists D. S. Mathewson, V. L. Ford and N. Visvanathan proposed that the SMC may in fact be split in two, with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the SMC (as seen from Earth's perspective), and separated by about 30,000 light years. They suggest the reason for this is due to a past interaction with the LMC splitting the SMC, and that the two sections are still moving apart. They have dubbed this smaller remnant the Mini Magellanic Cloud.[26][27]\nSee also\nAstronomical surveys of the Magellanic Clouds\nIrregular galaxy\nMagellanic Stream\nMagellanic Bridge\nGalaxies in fiction\n\n\nSources\nEric Chaisson and Steve McMillan, Astronomy Today (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1993), p.550.\nMichael Zeilik, Conceptual Astronomy (New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1993), pp.357\u20138.\n\n\n incl.

It was founded by and named after Manuel L. Quezon, the 2nd President of the Philippines, to replace Manila as the national capital. The city was proclaimed as capital in 1948 and held the status until 1976 when the proclamation was reverted.[4]\nIt is the largest city in terms of population and land area in Metro Manila, the National Capital Region of the Philippines. Quezon City is not located in and should not be confused with Quezon Province, which was also named after the president.\nQuezon City hosts a number of government offices, the most important of which are the Batasang Pambansa Complex (the seat of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the Philippine Congress), and the Quezon City Reception House (the current seat of the Vice President of the Philippines).[4] Quezon City also serves as home to the University of the Philippines Diliman\u2014the national university\u2014and Ateneo de Manila University.\nThe Quezon Memorial Circle is a national park and shrine located in Quezon City. The park is an ellipse bounded by the Elliptical Road. Its main feature is a mausoleum containing the remains of President Quezon and his wife, First Lady Aurora Quezon.\nHistory\n\nBefore Quezon City was created, its land was settled by the small individual towns of San Francisco del Monte, Novaliches, and Balintawak. On August 23, 1896, the Katipunan, led by its Supremo Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio, launched the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire at the house of Melchora Aquino in Pugad Lawin (now known as Balintawak).\nIn the early 20th century, President Manuel L. Quezon dreamt of a city that would become the future capital of the country to replace Manila. It is believed that his earlier trip in Mexico City, Mexico influenced his vision.[5][6]\nIn 1938, President Quezon created the People's Homesite Corporation and purchased 15.29km2 (6sqmi) from the vast Diliman Estate of the Tuason family; this piece of land became known then as Barrio Obrero (\"Workers' Village\"). The National Assembly of the Philippines passed Commonwealth Act 502, known as the Charter of Quezon City, originally proposed as \"Balintawak City; Assemblymen Narciso Ramos and Ramon Mitra Sr. successfully lobbied the assembly to name the city after the incumbent president. President Quezon allowed the bill to lapse into law without his signature on October 12, 1939, thus establishing Quezon City.[5][6]\nWhen Quezon City was created in 1939, the following barrios or sitios: Balingasa, Balintawak, Galas, Kaingin, Kangkong, La Loma, Malamig, Masambong, Matalahib, San Isidro, San Jose, Santol, and Tatalon from Caloocan; Cubao, the western half of Diliman, Kamuning, New Manila, Roxas and San Francisco del Monte from San Juan; Balara, Barangka, the eastern half of Diliman, Jesus de la Pe\u00f1a and Krus na Ligas from Marikina; Libis, Santolan and Ugong Norte from Pasig and some barrios from Montalban and San Mateo were to be given to the new capital city. Instead of opposing them, the six towns willingly gave land to Quezon City in the belief that it would benefit the country's new capital. However, in 1941, the area within Wack Wack Golf and Country Club was reverted to Mandaluyong, and Barangka and Jesus de la Pe\u00f1a to Marikina. In addition, the land of Camp Crame was originally part of San Juan.  On 1 January 1942, President Quezon issued an executive order from the tunnel of Corregidor designating Jorge Vargas Mayor of Greater Manila, a new political entity comprising, aside from Manila proper, Quezon City, Kalookan, Pasay, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Para\u00f1aque.  Greater Manila would later be expanded to include Las Pi\u00f1as, Malabon, and Navotas.\nImperial Japanese forces occupied Quezon City in 1942 during World War II. In October of that year, the Japanese authorities divided the City of Greater Manila into twelve districts, two of which were formed from Quezon City:  Balintawak which consisted of San Francisco del Monte, Galas, and La Loma; and Diliman which consisted of Diliman proper, Cubao, and the University District. In 1945, combined Filipino and American troops under the United States Army, Philippine Commonwealth Army, and Philippine Constabulary, with help from recognized guerrilla units, liberated and recaptured Quezon City in a few months, expelling Imperial Japanese forces.  Heavy fighting occurred near Novaliches, which at that time was in Rizal Province, and New Manila which was a strongpoint.  Toward the end of the Battle of Manila, Pres. Sergio Osme\u00f1a dissolved the Greater Manila Complex, which included the Japanese-created districts of Balintawak and Diliman which had been formed from the prewar Quezon City.\nAfter the war, Republic Act No. 333, which redefined the Caloocan\u2013Quezon City boundary, was signed by President Elpidio Quirino on July 17, 1948, declaring Quezon City to be the national capital, and specifying the city's area to be 156.60km2 (60sqmi). The barrios of Baesa, Bagbag, Banlat, Kabuyao, Novaliches Proper, Pasong Putik, Pasong Tamo, Pugad Lawin, San Bartolome and Talipapa, which belonged to Novaliches and had a combined area of about 8,100 hectares, were taken from Caloocan and ceded to Quezon City. This caused the territorial division of Caloocan into two non-contiguous parts, the South section being the more urbanized part, and the North half being sub-rural. On June 16, 1950, the Quezon City Charter was revised by Republic Act No. 537, changing the city's boundaries to an area of 153.59km2 (59sqmi).[5][6] Exactly six years after on June 16, 1956, more revisions to the city's land area were made by Republic Act No. 1575, which defined its area as 151.06km2 (58sqmi). According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology and Geoscience Australia on their study earthquake impact and risk assessment on the Greater Metropolitan Manila Area, the total area of Quezon City stood at 165.33km2 (64sqmi).[7][8]\nOn October 1, 1975, Quezon City was the actual site of the \"Thrilla in Manila\" boxing fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, which took place at the Araneta Coliseum. It was renamed as the \"Philippine Coliseum\" for the event.\nOn November 7, 1975, the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 824 of President Ferdinand Marcos established Metro Manila.[5][6] Quezon City became one of Metro Manila's 17 cities and municipalities. The next year, Presidential Decree No. 940 transferred the capital back to Manila on June 24, 1976. On March 31, 1978, President Marcos ordered the transfer of the remains of President Quezon from Manila North Cemetery to the completed Quezon Memorial Monument within Elliptical Road. On February 22, 1986, the Quezon City portion of the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (between Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo) became the venue of the bloodless People Power Revolution that overthrew Marcos.\nOn February 23, 1998, Republic Act. No. 8535 was signed by President Fidel Ramos.[5][6] The Act provided for the creation of the City of Novaliches comprising the 15 northernmost barangays of Quezon City. However, in the succeeding plebiscite on October 23, 1999, an overwhelming majority of Quezon City residents rejected the secession of Novaliches.\nQuezon City is the first local government in the Philippines with a computerized real estate assessment and payment system. The city government developed a database system that now contains around 400,000 property units with capability to record payments.[5][6]\nMaster Plans\nIn 1938, President Quezon made a decision to push for a new capital city. Manila was getting crowded, and his military advisors (reportedly) told him that Manila, being by the bay, was an easy target for bombing by naval guns in case of attack\u2013a real possibility in the late 1930s. Military advisers, however, did not anticipate aerial bombardment.[5][6]\nQuezon supported the idea of a new city at least 15km (9mi) away from Manila Bay (beyond the reach of naval guns). He contacted William E. Parsons, American architect and planner, who had been the consulting architect for the islands early in the American colonial period. Parsons came over in the summer of 1939 and helped select the Diliman (Tuason) estate as the site for the new city. Unfortunately he died later that year, leaving his partner Harry Frost to take over. Frost collaborated with Juan Arellano, engineer A.D. Williams, and landscape architect and planner Louis Croft to craft a grand master plan for the new capital.[5][6]\nThe plan was approved by the Philippine authorities in 1941. The core of the new city was to be a 400ha central green, about the size of New York's Central Park, and defined by North, South (Timog), East and West Avenues. On one corner of the proposed Diliman Quadrangle was delineated a 25-hectare elliptical site. This was to contain a large capitol building to house the Philippine Legislature and ancillary structures for the offices of representatives.[5][6]\nOn either side of the giant ellipse were supposed to have been the new Malaca\u00f1an Palace on North Avenue (site of the present-day Veterans Memorial Hospital), and the Supreme Court Complex along East Avenue (now the site of East Avenue Medical Center). The three branches of government were to be finally and efficiently located in close proximity to each other.[5][6]\n[top]\nGeography\n\nThe city lies on the Guadalupe Plateau, a relatively high plateau at the northeast of the metropolis situated between the lowlands of Manila to the southwest and the Marikina River Valley to the east. The southern portion is drained by the narrow San Juan River and its tributaries to Pasig River, while running in the northern portions of the city is the equally-narrow Tullahan River.\nQuezon City is bordered by Manila to the southwest, by Caloocan and Valenzuela City to the west and northwest. To the south lie San Juan and Mandaluyong, while Marikina and Pasig border the city to the southeast. To the north across Marilao River lies San Jose del Monte in the province of Bulacan, while to the east lie Rodriguez and San Mateo, both in the province of Rizal.\nThe city can be divided into a number of areas. The southern portion of the city is divided into a number of districts including Diliman, Commonwealth, the Project areas, Cubao, Kamias, Kamuning, New Manila, San Francisco del Monte, and Santa Mesa Heights. The northern half of the city is often called Novaliches and contains the areas of Fairview and Lagro. Most of these areas have no defined boundaries and are primarily residential in nature.\nClimate\nQuezon City features a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw\/Am), with prominent dry season from December to May, in which in turn, divided into cool and warm dry seasons, and a prolonged wet season from June to October that brings heavy rains in some areas.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation census of Quezon CityYearPop.\u00b1% p.a.1939 39,013\u20141948 107,977+11.98%1960 397,990+11.48%1970 754,452+6.60%1975 956,864+4.88%1980 1,165,865+4.03%1990 1,669,776+3.66%1995 1,989,419+3.34%2000 2,173,831+1.92%2007 2,679,450+2.93%2010 2,761,720+1.11%2015 2,936,116+1.17%Source: Philippine Statistics Authority[11][12][13]\nAccording to the 2015 Census, the population of the city was , making it by the most populous city in the Philippines. This figure is higher by more than 1.1 million from Manila, the country's second most populous city. \nThe increase in population of the city has been dramatic considering that it was only founded \/ consolidated (and sparsely populated) in 1939. Quezon City became the biggest city in terms of population in the Philippines in 1990 when it finally surpassed the number of inhabitants of the densely populated City of Manila. Quezon City's population continued to increase and went on to become the first Philippine city (and as of 2017 the only city) to reach 2 million people (in the late 1990s). Population is projected to reach 3 million people between the 2015 and 2020 census years and 4 million people between the 2025 and 2030 census years.[14]\nThe trend is also seen in the significant increase in the percentage share of Quezon City to the total population of what is now called Metro Manila. Its share comes from a low of less than 10% in the 1950s to 21.0%[15] in 1980 and then to 22.8% in 2015.\nReligion\n\n\nQuezon City is predominantly Roman Catholic with roughly 90% affiliation in the population; Novaliches Diocese had a 90% Roman Catholic adherence while the Diocese of Cubao had a Roman Catholic adherence of more than 88% (Catholic Diocese Hierarchy, 2003). In 2002, Quezon City was made an episcopal see for two new Catholic dioceses: Cubao and Novaliches, as the very populous Archdiocese of Manila was carved up and five new dioceses created.\nA number of religious orders have set up convents and seminaries in the city. Various Protestant faiths have seen a significant increase in membership over recent decades[16][17] and are well represented in Quezon City. While the Islamic faith has its largest concentrations in the south of the Philippines, there is a significant population in Quezon City. The Salam compound in Barangay Culiat houses one of the area's landmark mosques. Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) the second largest Christian denomination in the country, also has a large number of adherents with their large central temple in the city.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has the Manila Philippines Temple and the Missionary Training Center located at Temple Drive Greenmeadows Subdivision of the city. A branch of Jesus Is Lord Church which known as JIL, a Christian megachurch. The Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Also known as the \"Aglipayan Church\") has three (3) parishes located in the city, the Parish of the Crucified Lord in Apolonio Samson, Parish of the Holy Cross in Escale, University of the Philippines Diliman and the Parish of the Resurrection in Balingasa. The Kingdom of Jesus Christ, The Name Above Every Name of Pastor Apollo C. Quiboloy is located at Novaliches (Central Office), EDSA\u2013Cubao, Mu\u00f1oz, and Fairview. The biggest concentration of the Jesus Miracle Crusade of Evangelist Wilde E. Almeda is also located in the city. The Philippine Branch office of the Jehovah's Witnesses is located along Roosevelt Avenue. The seat of the Presiding Bishop, the Cathedral of Sts. Mary and John of the Episcopal Church, the national offices of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, the National Council of Churches in the Philippines as well as a number of Protestant seminaries are located in the city. The headquarters of the UCKG HelpCenter (Universal Church of the Kingdom of God) is located at the former Quezon Theater building. The headquarters of Bread of Life Ministries International is a Christian megachurch located in its own ministry center on Mother Ignacia Ave. in scout area. New Life NorthMetro, A satellite church of ANLCC (Alabang Newlife Christian Center) is located in Cinema 6, 4th level of Trinoma Mall.

The mayor is the executive head and leads the city's departments in executing the city ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads the legislative council consisting of 24 members. These councilors represent the six (6) legislative districts of the city. The council is in charge of formulating and enacting city ordinances.\nQuezon City, being a part of the Metro Manila region, has its mayor in the Metro Manila Council headed by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). This council formulates development plans that seeks to solve the problems and improve the conditions in the metropolis.\nMayors\n\nPresident Manuel L. Quezon acted as mayor from October 12 to November 4, 1939, pending the resignation from another position of his intended appointee, Tomas B. Morato. Since a president can, under Philippine law, hold multiple portfolios inferior to his office, Quezon took the position of mayor in a concurrent capacity. However, it is erroneous to view him as the first mayor, as a president holding a concurrent position is not listed in the roster of incumbents for those offices.\nBarangays\n\nQuezon City is made up of 142 barangays (the smallest local government units) which handle governance in a much smaller area. These barangays are grouped into the aforementioned legislative districts. Each district, in turn is represented in the House of Representatives.\nPublic Order and Safety\n\n\nPeace and order, which includes traffic management of the city is administered by the Quezon City Department of Public Order and Safety,[21] whose offices are found inside the Quezon City Hall Complex,[22] is headed by retired QCPD District Director \u2013 Police Chief Superintendent Elmo San Diego.[21]\nEmergency management for the city is administered by the Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council headed by Mayor Herbert Bautista[23] and Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction & Management Office[24] headed by its administrator; Dr. Noel Lansang.[22] The QCDRRMO will move out of the DPOS Building once construction of the QCDRRMO Building, near Gate 7 of the City Hall Complex, is completed 4th Quarter of 2014.[24]\nThe National Headquarters of the Philippine National Police[25] is located inside Camp Rafael Crame in Santolan, Quezon City and National Headquarters of the Bureau of Fire Protection[26] is located in Agham road, Quezon City. Supporting the PNP in administration, rehabilitation and protection of prisoners within the city is the Quezon City Jail and is run by Officers and Enlisted Personnel of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology.[27] The BJMP National Headquarters is located along Mindanao Avenue in Project 8.[28]\nThe Quezon City Police District[29] of the National Capital Region Police Office[30] is responsible for law enforcement in the city.

Similarly, there are nineteen (19) fire sub-stations strategically located within the city. District Headquarters are located inside the Quezon City Hall Complex.[22]\nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines'[33] General Headquarters[34] is in Camp Emilio Aguinaldo[35] in Murphy, Quezon City. The AFP Joint Task Force NCR[36] is also housed inside Camp Aguinaldo. Several reserve units of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which include the 1502nd Infantry Brigade (Ready Reserve), 201st Infantry Battalion (Ready Reserve),[37] 202nd Infantry Battalion (Ready Reserve) of the Army Reserve Command[38] and the 11th Air Force Group (Reserve)[39] of the Air Force Reserve Command[40] are also found in Quezon City and may render assistance to this local government unit during emergencies.[41] The 105th Technical & Administrative Services Group (Reserve), specifically the 1st Technical & Administrative Services Unit (Ready Reserve) of the AFP Reserve Command[42] provide technical assistance to these maneuver units. Collectively, these units function similar to that of the US National Guard.\nThe Philippine Coast Guard Auxiliary,[43] 106th Coast Guard Auxiliary Squadron,[44] provides water search and rescue capabilities to disaster response agencies of Quezon City.

The number of barangays per district is: District I, 37; District II, 5; District III, 37; District IV, 38; District V, 14; and District VI, 11; Although District II has the fewest barangays, it is the biggest in land area, including the Novaliches Reservoir.\nThe La Mesa Watershed Reservation in Novaliches is the last forest of its size in the metropolis; the La Mesa Dam is an earth dam whose reservoir can hold up to 50.5 million cubic meters and occupying an area of 27 square kilometres (10sqmi), it is also part of the Angat\u2013Ipo\u2013La Mesa water system which supplies most of the water supply of Metro Manila.\nBagumbayan\nLocated at the southeastern corner of Quezon City, Bagumbayan is one of the newly developed commercial areas in Quezon City. The Eastwood City Business Center is situated here. It consists of several office and residential skyscrapers, including many local IT and consumer electronic firms. Numerous bars and restaurants have been put up since 2000 along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5). Many of which are open-air restaurants and coffee shops reminiscent of Paris boulevards, but with a modern architecture. With this, Bagumbayan is fast becoming one of the hippest areas for night entertainment, similar to the Malate and Ermita districts of Manila.\nWest of Bagumbayan are many high-end gated communities like the Acropolis, Blue Ridge, Greenmeadows, White Plains, Corinthian Hills, and Corinthian Gardens. Further west are Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame. Camp Aguinaldo is the general headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines while Camp Crame is the headquarters of the Philippine National Police. Bagumbayan also covers a sliver of Ortigas Center business district at the southeast corner of EDSA and Ortigas Avenue, where Robinsons Galleria, the EDSA Shrine, and Cyberpod Corinthian are located.\nCommonwealth Avenue\n\nNorth of Diliman lies the Commonwealth area, so named because of Commonwealth Avenue (R-7) (formerly called Don Mariano Marcos Avenue) which runs through its center. Barangays in this area include Batasan Hills, Barangay Commonwealth, Holy Spirit and Old Balara. This is primarily a residential area home to many subdivisions (residential associations), among these are Ferndale Villas, Don Antonio Royale, Don Antonio Heights, BF Homes QC, Ferndale Homes, Vista Real, Filinvest 1 and 2, New Capitol Estates and others. The government center in Quezon City was originally planned to be at what is now the location of the Quezon Memorial Circle,[45] but it was then moved further north to where Batasan hills is now. Resultantly, there are important government establishments nearby such as the Commission on Audit of the Philippines, the Sandiganbayan, a special court with a rank equivalent to the Court of Appeals and the Batasang Pambansa Complex, which houses the lower house of the Philippine Congress. Schools within the Commonwealth area include the School of the Holy Spirit, Our Lady of Mercy School, Diliman Preparatory School, The Seed Montessori, Mary the Queen College, Capitol Hills Christian School, and the Asian Institute of Computer Studies. Ironically, this is also an area of sheer contrasts and a display of the acute economic differences in Metro Manila, with kilometers of shanty houses aligning the avenue on both sides. Parts of these are often being demolished just to be re-occupied by informal settlers soon after.\nCubao\n\n\nCubao, south of Diliman is an important commercial area. At its heart is the Araneta Center along EDSA (C-4) and Aurora Boulevard (R-6). It is a 35-hectare commercial estate owned and developed by the Araneta family.

The studios and transmitter of RPN\/CNN Philippines are located along Panay Avenue, in Barangay South Triangle.\n\nSeveral of the streets in the surrounding area were named in honor of the 22 Boy Scouts who died in a plane crash en route to joining the 11th World Scout Jamboree. A memorial stands in the center of a rotunda at the intersection of Timog and Tomas Morato Avenues, which accounts for the Timog area being called the 'Scout Area'. Near the scouting memorial is the location of the former Ozone disco, site of the worst fire in Philippine history.\nThe Quezon City Hall, one of the tallest city halls in the country, is located along the Circle. Surrounding the city hall are spacious parks and open areas. The head offices of some national government agencies are located in Diliman.

He was made the first Marquis of Novaliches, a title bestowed with Grandeza de Espana (Grandee of Spain--- first class rank among the nobility), in the 1840s.  Novaliches or \"New Liches\" came from an old district of Granada, Spain also known as \"Liches\" where Manuel and his ancestors, the Pav\u00edas, originate.  By the early 1850s, he reluctantly accepted the post of Governor General of the Philippines.  He ruthlessly crushed the rebellion started by Jos\u00e9 Cuesta of Cavite, a Spanish mestizo who rounded carbineros and natives to fight the Spanish military government, one of the many uprisings where even half-Spanish Filipinos began revolting.\nNovaliches is Quezon City's northernmost district and is primarily residential.

The transmitter located inside the Novaliches facility, however, is still used.[18][60]\nIn 1999, a plebiscite was held among the voters of Quezon City to determine the cityhood of Novaliches. The proposed creation of \"Novaliches City\"[61] would have resulted in the secession of 15 barangays from Quezon City. At the plebiscite's end, votes that were against the separation heavily outnumbered those that were in favor.[62]\nNovaliches is also home to the oldest church of the Diocese of Novaliches and the town itself, the Parish and Shrine of Our Lady of Mercy or the Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes. The parish was founded on September 24, 1856 by Padre Andres Martin, O.S.A.\nNearby the Church of Las Mercedes is the huge tree where Andres Bonifacio and Tandang Sora held meetings to fight in the revolution against Spain. It is located in the grounds of Metro Manila College in Barangay Kaligayahan and has withstood typhoons for more than 200 years.\nSan Francisco del Monte\n\nFounded as a pueblo by Saint Pedro Bautista in 1590, San Francisco del Monte may be considered Quezon City's oldest district. The original land area of the old town of San Francisco del Monte was approximately2.5 square kilometres (1.0sqmi) and covered parts of what is currently known as Project 7 and 8 and Timog Avenue. It was later absorbed by Quezon City. It featured a hilly topography with lush vegetation and mineral springs, in the midst of which the old Santuario de San Pedro Bautista was built as a retreat and monastery for Franciscan friars.\nCurrently, it is composed of Barangays San Antonio, Paraiso, Paltok, Mariblo, Damayan and Del Monte. San Francisco del Monte is also referred to as S.F.D.M.. The district is bisected by its two major thoroughfares, Roosevelt Avenue and Del Monte Avenue. It is bounded by West Avenue on the east, Epifanio De Los Santos Avenue on the north, Quezon Avenue on the south, and Araneta Avenue on the west.\nThe studios and transmitter of IBC are located along Roosevelt Avenue, in San Francisco del Monte.\nToday, it is a heavily populated district with a mix of residential, industrial, and commercial areas. The most prominent educational institutions located in the area are Siena College of Quezon City, Angelicum College, and PMI Colleges, while Fisher Mall is the largest commercial establishment.\nSanta Mesa Heights\n\nSanta Mesa Heights is said to be where many middle-class and upper-middle-class families reside. Most of the areas in Santa Mesa Heights are residential. It is also home to the National Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes and The National Shrine of Our Lady of La Naval (Sto. Domingo Church). Angelicum College, Lourdes School of Quezon City, and St. Theresa's College of Quezon City are three prestigious private Catholic schools to be found here. Philippine Rehabilitation Institute and Capitol Medical Center Colleges are also located here. This is also a location of Philippine Orthopedic Center located along Banawe Avenue corner Maria Clara Street. And also the headquarters of Mareco Broadcasting Network (Crossover 105.1) located along Tirad Pass street. The main thoroughfares of this area are Banawe, D. Tuazon, Mayon, N.S. Amoranto (formerly called Retiro), Del Monte, Sgt. Rivera, and Andres Bonifacio Avenue.\nTandang Sora\n\nThis is located between Commonwealth to the east, North Ave to the south, San Francisco del Monte (Frisco) Avenue to the west, and Fairview\u2013Sauyo to the north. It takes its name from the \"Grand Old Lady of the Revolution\", Melchora Aquino or Tandang Sora, whose remains lie at the Tandang Sora National Shrine on Banlat Road, Barangay Tandang Sora.\nThe area is primarily residential with Projects 6 and 8 located here, as are other subdivisions, like Town & Country Gardenville, San Pedro Subdivisions, National Power Corporation or NPC Village, National Irrigation Administration or NIA Village, Reymar Subdivision, Philand Subdivision, Villa Corrina,Pleasantview Subdivision, San Miguel Village, Gloria Subdivisions, Jem Subdivisions, Corazonville subdivision, Villa Concepcion, Villa Lourdes, Macaya street, and many more. A large portion of Tandang Sora district is Barangay Bahay Toro, where a historic site of the Philippine Revolution known as Pugad Lawin is located. There are some industrial facilities especially near the Mindanao Avenue area. Culiat, a Muslim compound, is also to be found here, as are the central offices of the Iglesia ni Cristo, New Era University and the studios and transmitter of Net 25 INC TV 49, Radyo Agila, Pinas FM and INC Radio of the Eagle Broadcasting Corporation and Christian Era Broadcasting Service International. The transmitter of GMA Network and Barangay LS 97.1 is located near Culiat. Many educational centers are also within the area such as Colegio De San Lorenzo, St. Patrick School, St. James College, Maria Montesoori, and etc.. Also in the area are Congressional Avenue, Visayas Avenue, and Mindanao Avenue (forming part of C-5).\nThe Project Areas\nThe housing Project areas are among the first residential subdivisions in the city developed by Presidents Quezon, Quirino, and Magsaysay:\nProject 1 (Barangay Roxas or Roxas District)\nProjects 2 and 3 (composed of all the Barangays named Quirino)\nProject 4 (see \"Cubao\" District)\nProject 5 (Barangay E. Rodriguez)\nProject 6 (Barangay Project 6)\nProject 7 (Barangays Bungad and Veterans Village)\nProject 8 (Barangays Bahay Toro, Baesa and Sangandaan).\nTriangle Park (Central Business District)\n\nUgong Norte\nUgong Norte, though some of its area is shared with Bagumbayan, is the boundary of Quezon City with Pasig and houses the posh villages of Acropolis Subdivision, Corinthian Gardens and Green Meadows. Found along ADB avenue, the headquarters of the Asian Development Bank is partly located within area of Ugong Norte. Robinsons Galleria and the Crowne Plaza Manila can be found along Ortigas avenue near the EDSA Shrine. Saint Pedro Poveda College sit beside Robinsons Galleria along EDSA.\nSister cities\n\nQuezon City's sister cities are:[63]\nInternational\n\nLocal\n\nIn art and popular culture\nQuezon City is the setting for much of F.H.

{"question":"How old is the Academy of Natural Sciences at Drexel University?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"passage_indices":[-1,-1,0],"start_positions":[-1,-1,-1],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","NONE","NONE"]},"context":["\n\nThe Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, formerly the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, is the oldest natural science research institution and museum in the Americas. It was founded in 1812, by many of the leading naturalists of the young American republic with an expressed mission of \"the encouragement and cultivation of the sciences\". For over two centuries of continuous operations, the Academy has sponsored expeditions, conducted original environmental and systematics research, and amassed natural history collections containing more than 17 million specimens. The Academy also has a long tradition of public exhibits and educational programs for both schools and the general public.\nHistory\nDuring the first decades of the United States, Philadelphia was the cultural capital and one of the country's commercial centers. Two of the city's institutions, the Library Company and the American Philosophical Society, were centers of enlightened thought and scientific inquiry.\nThe increasing sophistication of the earth and life sciences, combined with a growing awareness of the great variety of life and landscape in the American wilderness waiting to be discovered, led a small group of naturalists to establish the Academy of Natural Sciences in the winter of 1812. The academy was meant to foster a gathering of fellow naturalists, and nurture the growth and credibility of American science. They frequently looked to their European counterparts for inspiration and expertise and longed to be regarded as equals.\nOn 25 April 1817 they were incorporated into the society under the title of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by the legislature of Pennsylvania. By 1 January 1818, eight members were published.[1]\nWithin a decade of its founding, the Academy became the undisputed center of natural sciences in the United States. Academy members were frequently enlisted to participate in national surveys of the western territories and other major expeditions. Several of its earliest members, including William Bartram, John Godman, Richard Harlan, Angelo Heilprin, Charles Alexandre Lesueur, William Maclure, Titian Peale, Charles Pickering, Thomas Say, and Alexander Wilson were among the pioneers or recognized authorities in their respective areas of study. Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, John Edwards Holbrook of South Carolina, Thomas Nuttall and  Richard Owen of the United Kingdom, Georges Cuvier of France, and Alexander von Humboldt of Prussia were among the corresponding members (members who lived far from Philadelphia) of the Academy's first decades.\nLater during the 19th century, other notable naturalists and scientists,[2] including John James Audubon, Charles S. Boyer, John Cassin, Edward Drinker Cope, Ezra Townsend Cresson, Richard Harlan, Ferdinand V. Hayden, Isaac Lea, John Lawrence LeConte, Joseph Leidy,[3] Samuel Morton, George Ord, and James Rehn were also members. Corresponding members included such luminaries as Charles Darwin, Asa Gray, and Thomas Henry Huxley.\nFor much of its history, new members had to be nominated by two current members and then elected by the remaining members. These requirements were dropped in 1924. Notable 20th-century scientists include James B\u00f6hlke, James Bond, Henry Weed Fowler, Ruth Patrick, Henry Pilsbry, and Witmer Stone.\nIn 2011, the Academy became affiliated with nearby Drexel University and changed its name to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.[4][5]\nCollections and research\n\nCollections are the hallmark of museums and those at The Academy of Natural Sciences are among the more important of their kind. The size and scope of its collections have grown substantially since the early years. Currently, there are over 18 million biological specimens, and hundreds of thousands of volumes, journals, illustrations, photographs, and archival items in its library. These collections grew through a combination of means, including the donation or purchase of existing collections or individual items, the collection activities of Academy-sponsored expeditions, or those of individual scientists, whether or not they work at the Academy. Sometimes the Academy is also enlisted to house and care for collections originally gathered by other institutions. For example, a number of the natural history collections at the American Philosophical Society were relocated to the Academy by the end of the 19th century.\nBut these collections are not maintained just to collect dust. They provide a library of biodiversity. Traditionally, researchers at natural science (or natural history) institutions such as the Academy engaged in biological taxonomy, the science of discovering, describing, naming, and classifying species: in essence, the cataloging of Nature. In recent decades, research has shifted in emphasis to the science of systematics, the study of the evolutionary relationships among these species.\nEither way, the collections are invaluable. They provide the type specimens, the reference material that helps establish a species' identity. They also provide raw materials with which scientists can investigate the nature of these species, their relationships with other species, their evolutionary history, or their conservation status. New questions and new technology illustrate the importance of these collections. Titian Peale (1799\u20131885) may not have been interested in the conservation biology of the butterflies he collected while Henry Pilsbry (1862\u20131957) probably did not consider comparing the DNA of his snails. Yet, modern scientists have such options because these specimens are part of the collections.\nBiological systematics\nThe most common science currently conducted in natural history museums is biological systematics. It is also the science with which current natural history collections are most intimately associated.  The Academy's collections and systematics research are presented below.\n\nBotany\nBotany  is study of plants. \"Plants,\" to most people, means a wide range of living organisms from the smallest bacteria to the largest living things - the giant sequoia trees. By this definition plants include: algae, fungi, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers and flowering plants.\nCollections at the Academy, which are housed in the Philadelphia Herbarium (PH), include some of the oldest and most important botanical collections in the Americas. Notable early collectors include Benjamin Smith Barton, Constatine Rafinesque, Thomas Meehan, Thomas Nuttall, and Fredrick Pursh. The current curator, Tatyana Livshultz, studies the systematics of and the development of flowers in  the Apocynaceae (milkweed or dogbane family). The herbarium contains approximately 1.5 million specimens of vascular plants, fungi, lichens, algae, and fossil plants. It also contains some special collections, including the plants collected by Johann and Georg Forster during the voyages of Captain James Cook, and by Meriwether Lewis during the Lewis and Clark expedition (Corps of Discovery).\nDiatoms\nThe Academy's Diatom Herbarium, the largest in the Americas and the second largest in the world, contains approximately 220,000 slides of these microscopic algae. The herbarium contains many specimens contributed by notable collectors, a diversity of fossil diatoms, and diatoms collected as part of numerous freshwater environmental surveys in the United States. The Diatom Herbarium also provides collections and taxonomic services for the Phycology Section of the Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Former curators of note include Charles S. Boyer, Ruth Patrick, and Charles Reimer.\nEntomology\nEntomology has been important to the Academy since its founding. Two of its earliest members include Thomas Say, regarded as the father of American entomology, and Titian Peale, a leading natural history illustrator and the chief naturalist on the United States Exploring Expedition (1834\u20131842). The entomology collection currently contains more than 3.5 million specimens and includes the remarkable Titian Peale Moth and Butterfly Collection, the oldest entomology collection in the United States. Curator Emeritus, Daniel Otte, an expert on Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers, and their relatives) is a pioneer of presenting biological data on the internet through the creation of the . Curator and Entomology Department Chair, Jon Gelhaus is a world expert on crane flies and manages the Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey.\nIchthyology\nIchthyology has also been a part of Academy collections and research since its beginnings, but the size of the collection was relatively modest until acquisition of Edward Drinker Cope's personal collections in 1898. A few years later, Henry Weed Fowler began his remarkable tenure at the Academy, during which he systematized the collections and described 1,408 species. James Edwin B\u00f6hlke, William Saul, and William Smith-Vaniz are among the notable scientist who followed Fowler. The current curator, John Lundberg, an expert in catfishes, pioneered deep channel collecting in large tropical rivers and is the lead author of a seminal scientific paper on the biological and geographic history of the Amazon River Basin. The Ichthyology collection, which currently houses nearly 1.2 million specimens and nearly 3,000 types, is one of the most important such collections in the United States. The department also hosts the  (a comprehensive online resource on catfish) and  (an online digital atlas of catfish morphology), and is a participant in  (an online resource of Neotropic ichthyology collections).\nMalacology\nTwo of the early members of the Academy, Thomas Say and Isaac Lea, were malacologists (see also conchologists). R. Tucker Abbott, Samuel Stehman Haldeman, Henry A. Pilsbry, and George W. Tryon, Jr. were other noted malacologists who worked at the Academy. The Academy's malacology collection is the oldest such collection in the United States and is the 3rd largest in the world. It currently contains over 10 million specimens, including types erected by more than 400 authors. Curator Gary Rosenberg, an expert on Jamaican land snails, is a leader in moving museum collections and research data online. Research websites include the  an online database of , and the  database.  Research associate and former curator Daniel L. Graf, an expert on Unionidae (freshwater mussels), maintains the  web site.\nOrnithology\nJust about any ornithologist active in the United States during the first half of the 19th century, including John James Audubon, William Bartram, Charles Lucien Bonaparte, John Cassin, Thomas Nuttall, George Ord, John Kirk Townsend, and Alexander Wilson (the \"father\" of American ornithology), either operated out of or worked closely with The Academy of Natural Sciences. Later notable Academy ornithologists include James Bond, Frank Gill, Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee, Pete Myers, Fred Sheldon, and Witmer Stone. With nearly 200,000 specimens representing over 9,000 species, the Ornithology collection is one of the largest and most taxonomically complete bird collections in the world. The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club (DVOC) has held regular meetings at the Academy since 1890.\nVertebrate paleontology\nVertebrate paleontology in the United States originated in Philadelphia through the efforts of naturalists and scientists associated with the American Philosophical Society (APS) during the first decade of the 19th century and at The Academy of Natural Sciences thereafter. By the end of the 19th century, the holdings from the APS, including the , had been transferred to the Academy for safekeeping. Currently, the collection contains more than 22,000 specimens, including many types. Richard Harlan was an early member who introduced many American naturalists to the groundbreaking works of Georges Cuvier. , who described Hadrosaurus and alerted the scientific world to the paleontological treasures of the American West, is considered the \"father\" of American vertebrate paleontology. Edward Drinker Cope, who also worked extensively on other vertebrates, is best known for his rivalry with Othniel Charles Marsh during the infamous Bone Wars. Curator Edward B. Daeschler is currently studying the evolution of Devonian tetrapods. He is a co-discoverer of the transitional \"fishapod\" Tiktaalik roseae from the Canadian Arctic and the discoverer of two tetrapods, Hynerpeton and Densignathus from the Catskill Formation in Pennsylvania.\nOther collections\nThe Academy houses several collections of smaller size yet historical and scientific importance. The general invertebrate collection contains about 22,600 specimens, while the invertebrate paleontology collection contains about 105,000 lots. Both contain numerous type specimens. Generally, 21,500 specimens are gaunt, 13,500 are affiliated skins, and 1,700 are wet-preserved specimens.[6]  The Frank J. Myers Rotifer Collection is the most comprehensive collection of rotifers on microslides. The herpetology collection contains about 40,000 specimens, including more than 500 type specimens. The mammalogy collection contains about 36,000 specimens and 180 holotypes. Among the naturalists and scientists associated with these collections are Timothy Conrad, Edward Drinker Cope, Richard Harlan, John Edwards Holbrook, Henry Charles Lea, Isaac Lea, Joseph Leidy, Samuel G. Morton, and Thomas Say.\nPatrick Center for Environmental Research\nFormerly the Limnology Department, the Patrick Center for Environmental Research concerns itself with applied ecology. Founded in 1947 by Ruth Patrick, formerly of the Diatom Herbarium, it was one of the earliest U.S. environmental consulting concerns. Its attachment to the Academy led it to become the first to employ interdisciplinary teams of scientists to study freshwater systems and the first to regard biodiversity as a central criterion of water quality.\nIts 1948 biological survey of the Conestoga River Basin in Pennsylvania, a milestone in environmental research, led to similar surveys and studies throughout much of the United States. Characteristically, these earlier projects were joint projects of the Limnology Department and private industry. Since the rise of the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s and the resulting increases in governmental regulation of water pollution, the environmental assessments pioneered at the Academy are increasingly conducted by private environmental consulting firms.\nAs of 2013, much of the research at the Patrick Center is conducted with regulatory agencies and other governmental bodies, in fields such as diatom autecology,[7] environmental chemistry and toxicology, habitat restoration, long-term environmental trends, species conservation, and watershed management. Some of the work employs most of the center's expertise and capabilities, such as recent studies on the ecological effects of small dams or the ecological benefits of riparian reforestation.\nOther studies may involve only one or a couple of the research programs. For example, a current project sampling sediment cores in tidal marshes throughout the Delaware Estuary.[8] This undertaking, possibly the most comprehensive core sampling in any estuary, relies extensively on the center's expertise in biogeochemistry and phycology. Once the sampling is completed, scientist will be able to investigate historical trends in marsh development, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, water pollution, salinity variations, and climatic change by analyzing the core's sediments, chemistry, and diatom assemblages.\nBiogeochemistry\nThe Biogeochemistry Section of the Patrick Center is concerned with the influence of aquatic organisms on the sources, fate and transport of chemicals in aquatic systems. Studies frequently deal with the carbon and nutrient cycling as well as those of trace elements (e.g., lead, copper, mercury, and zinc) and organic contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The section regularly provides water, sediment and tissue analyses for government, intergovernmental agencies, and private companies from around the country. In addition to the sediment core project mentioned above, it has recently studied the effects of small dams on sediment contaminants, photochemical transformation of marsh-derived dissolved organic matter, and sedimentation and eutrophication in salt marshes.\nEcological Modeling\nThe Ecological Modeling Section employs sophisticated and rigorous mathematical modeling techniques to address a variety of questions in basic and applied research. Examples include watershed-scale modeling and risk assessment; nonlinear population models structured by age, body size, or space; particle transport in turbulent aquatic systems; and the ecology and control of exotic invasive plants in urban parks.\nFisheries\nThe Fisheries Section of the Patrick Center conducts research into the ecology, conservation, and management of lotic and estuarine fishes. Studies may range from the analysis of fish tissues for contaminants, monitoring fish populations for environmental assessments, to investigating the life histories of individual species. Recent and ongoing work include, glass eel (the larvae of freshwater or American eels) recruitment in the Delaware River basin, the ecology and genetics of bridal shiner (a fish that's endangered in Pennsylvania), and the impacts of flow management (dam releases) in the Upper Delaware River to native and introduced fish populations.\nMacroinvertebrates\nBenthic macroinvertebrates (primarily aquatic insects, crustaceans, and mollusks) are useful for biological monitoring programs. Their varied life spans, ranging from weeks to years, are long enough to reveal intermittent and continuous pollutants, yet short enough respond to worsening or improving water quality. The Macroinvertebrate Section at the Patrick Center has extensive experience in bioassessment, biomonitoring, and inventorying of freshwater habitats throughout the United States.\nPhycology\nBecause of their great diversity and specific ecological requirements, algae, particularly diatoms, make excellent indicators of water quality. Moreover, diatoms are readily preserved in sediments, which make them ideal organisms for studying paleolimnology (the long-term trends of streams and lakes). Because of their expertise and their close working relationship with the Academy's Diatom Herbarium, the Phycology Section of the Patrick Center is able to provide algal analyses for governmental and other agencies interested in both assessing water quality and long-term environmental trends. One such undertaking is the analyses of diatom assemblages in lake sediments (sediment cores) throughout the eastern United States. This work, part of a large project managed by the EPA, will try to establish reference (pre-anthropogenic) conditions  for lakes throughout the country.\nIn addition to these research efforts, the Phycology Section of the Patrick Center has developed a set of  for using algae in environmental research. These include an algal image database, autecology datasets for freshwater algae, algae research with the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program, and a diatom paleolimnology database.\nLaboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology\nFor most of its history, biological taxonomy and systematics were conducted using comparative morphology. In recent decades, however, advances in molecular biology and computational technologies have opened new possibilities for studying the diversity and history of life through the use of cladistics and computational phylogenetics. These technologies also offer new opportunities for molecular ecology and conservation genetics.\nAcademy scientists have been early adapters of molecular biology techniques. Allozymes, DNA-DNA hybridization, immunoelectrophoresis, restriction site analyses of mitochondrial DNA and serology were used extensively since the late 1960s. Recent molecular work mainly employs DNA sequencing, microsatellites, and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism). In 2004, the Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology (LMSE) was formed as a shared, multi-user facility to improve access to and provide training for the use of molecular data in systematic and ecological research. In addition to supporting staff, the lab offers research opportunities for students and post-doctoral fellowships.\nAsia Center\nThe Asia Center is a new initiative to develop programs and partnerships for research and capacity building throughout Asia. Clyde Goulden is the director of the Asia Center. It is modeled on a series of successful programs conducted in Mongolia since 1995 under the auspices of the Academy's Institute for Mongolian Biodiversity and Ecological Studies (IMBES). The main activities of IMBES occur in the vicinity of Lake Hovsgol in northern Mongolia, but a separate program, the Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey, extends to other parts of the country. More recently, the Asia Center has undertaken joint-projects with Nanjing University, Nanjing Paleontological Museum and Zhejiang Ocean University in China and the Institute of the Biological Problems of the North in the Russian Far East.\nHovsgol\nThe Academy's work in Mongolia started with the realization of the unique research opportunities available at Lake Hovsgol (Hovsgol Nuur). This large lake and its watershed were remarkably pristine and relatively unknown, especially in comparison to its sister lake in Russia, Lake Baikal. In 1995, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from the Academy, as well as from other American institutions, Mongolia, Russia, and Japan started a multi-year study of the lake's biodiversity, limnology, and watershed.[9]\nAlthough this research was scientifically rewarding, it was apparent that issues concerning environmental protection and sustainable economic development needed addressing.[10] Consequently, work at Hovsgol shifted to ecosystem studies and capacity building.[11] One early undertaking was the enhancement of the operational and physical infrastructure at Hovsgol National Park.[12] Long-term ecological monitoring of several tributary watersheds began in 1997 and soon the site would be adopted into the \n.[13]\nRecent work at Hovsgol is focusing on the consequences of and sustainable responses to climate change. The region lies in a transitional zone between the semi-arid Eurasian Steppe (grasslands) to the south and the Eurasian Taiga (boreal forest) to the north. As such, it is an ideal mid-continental site at which to monitor the ecological effects of climate change.[14] In addition, changes in livestock herding practices[15] raise concerns about overgrazing and desertification. In response, the team at Hovsgol created and distributed a Herder Handbook[16] and continues to conduct research and work with nomadic herders to develop sustainable practices.[17]\nMongolian Aquatic Insect Survey\nThe Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey[18] is a multi-year biodiversity survey, environmental monitoring and capacity building project managed by Jon Gelhaus of the Academy's Entomology Department.  A total of 217 sites from the Selenge River Basin, the most populous and most extensive drainage in Mongolia, were surveyed from 2003 to 2006. Most of these sites are in rivers or streams, but some are in freshwater and saltwater lakes, hot and cold springs, and marsh wetlands. Additional sites from the remote drainage systems in western Mongolia will be sampled in 2008.\nThe survey has yielded numerous new species and hundreds of geographic records for known aquatic insects, provided an extensive dataset for ongoing environmental monitoring, and has helped develop research and technical infrastructures in Mongolia. This capacity building includes, in collaboration with the Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology, the building of the first research laboratory in Mongolia dedicated to the study of aquatic invertebrates. It also includes training of Mongolian scientists and students.\nCenter for Environmental Policy\nThe Center for Environmental Policy informs and engages various constituents, promotes solutions, and builds public and professional awareness on important environmental topics. Much of its activities focus on public programs and working groups.\nThe center hosts or participates in a number of public programs that are free and open to the public. Urban Sustainability Forums feature panels of local and national experts discussing environmental and sustainability topics as they relate to the Philadelphia region. Town Square, which may feature a panel or an individual, addresses a variety of topics relating to the environment or public science. The center also hosts candidate forums, conferences and workshops.\nThe center acts as a logistical hub for a number of Working Groups organized around sustainability issues. Currently active groups one for condominium and building co-op owners, a network of faith-based environmental groups, and a forum of senior executives in the private sector.\nEwell Sale Stewart Library\nThe Library and Archives were established at the Academy's founding meeting in 1812 for the purpose of supporting its natural science research. The library provides online access, services, collections, imaging, and shared resources with other libraries.\nThe library houses nearly 200,000 volumes ranging from works published in the 16th century to current journals and books. Its holdings also include  illustrated works from as early as the 15th century, including Konrad Gessner's Historia animalium, Maria Sibylla Merian's Insects of Surinam, Edward Lear's Psittacidae or Parrots, and a double elephant folio of John James Audubon's The Birds of America.[19]\nScientific publications\nThe Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences was the first peer-reviewed publication in the United States devoted to the natural sciences. The first volume was published in 1817.  By 1842, it had been superseded by the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences. The Proceedings have been published continuously since 1841. The Journal was reborn in 1847 as a larger-format publication that could accommodate longer articles and monographs. The last volume was issued in 1918.[20]\nThe Academy publishes three other series. The occasional series Notulae Naturae began in 1939 as a means to quickly publish short items, usually not longer than 16 pages on subject areas such as zoology, botany, ecology, geology and paleontology. The Monographs series, which began in 1935, is composed principally of larger systematic reviews of selected taxonomic groups. The Special Publications series, begun in 1922, includes works such as biography, taxonomy, historical reviews, and collections surveys.\nVIREO\n (VIsual REsource for Ornithology) is the most comprehensive collection of bird images in the world. Started in 1979, the collection contains over 140,000 photographs representing more than 7,000 species. The collection contains work by some of the world's most talented photographers. VIREO licenses bird images for a wide variety of commercial and non-profit uses.\nExhibits and public programs\nPublic exhibits\n\nThe Academy first opened its collections to the public in 1828. The popularity of its exhibits soared in 1868 with the debut of the world's first mounted dinosaur skeleton, Hadrosaurus.  In fact, the size of the crowds flocking to this display prompted the Academy to relocate to its present-and roomier-location in 1876.\nCollections and the public\nAs with most museums in the 19th century, there was little separation of the Academy's collections, which were vital to scientific work, and the public spaces. Not only did this subject the collections to extra wear and tear, but visitors were typically confronted with a bewildering assemblage of specimens with little in the way of supplemental information. Over time, however, museums such as the Academy started to showcase their more popular specimens while sequestering the bulk of the collections. In addition, they spent more effort interpreting their public displays. Museums started to play a more active role in educating the public.[21]\nDioramas\nOne expression of this transformation was the rise of that icon of natural history museums, the diorama. These three-dimensional displays were the virtual reality of their time, providing generations of museum visitors with their only opportunity to experience distant places and exotic wildlife. By presenting the wilderness to the public, dioramas nurtured an appreciation of our natural heritage, which, in turn, contributed to the growth of the Conservation Movement in the United States. The Academy currently has 37 dioramas, most of which were installed in the 1930s and 1940s. They feature a variety of animals from Africa, Asia, and North America. Some of these, such as the caribou, lion, and plains zebra are familiar and relatively common, but others, such as the desert bighorn, kiang, Kodiak bear, panda, and passenger pigeon, are threatened, endangered, or extinct.\nDinosaurs\n\nAnother icon of natural history museums is the dinosaur skeleton. The first of these, the Hadrosaurus mount created by noted natural history artist Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, made its debut at the Academy in 1868. Hadrosaurus mounts also found their way into other public venues, including Princeton University, the Royal Scottish Museum, the Smithsonian, and the 1876 American Centennial Exposition. A special exhibit on the history of Hadrosaurus foulkii ran from November 22, 2008 to April 19, 2009.\n\nA skeletal mount of a related dinosaur, Corythosaurus, served as the centerpiece of the Academy's \"Hall of Earth History\" during the middle of the 20th century. In 1986, the Academy opened a new exhibit, \"Discovering Dinosaurs.\" This was the first large-scale exhibit to incorporate the findings of the \"dinosaur renaissance.\" Instead of cold-blooded and lumbering reptiles, dinosaurs were conceived as active-and possibly warm-blooded-animals more akin to birds than lizards.\nIn 1979 another type of dinosaur was the subject of an exhibition at the academy when it featured Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs and found that it was an enormous success with the public. This unconventional exhibition for a museum of science that featured contemporary sculpture, which focused upon the subjects of intense scientific inquiry, began a trend among its peer institutions, who then began to invite Gary and several other artists who specialized in scientific topics and subjects to museums that always had shied away from anything identified as \"contemporary art\" as exhibitions.[22]\nOther exhibits\nIn 1979, the academy also opened \"Outside-In\", a hands-on children's nature museum. In 1995, it pioneered the hands-on simulation of a dinosaur dig, with its \"The Big Dig.\" Other permanent exhibits include \"Butterflies!\", a live butterfly zoo, and  \"Science at the Academy\", which showcases current Academy research.\nThe museum also has special, changing exhibits. Recent changing exhibits include \"Amazon Voyage: Vicious Fishes and Other Riches\", \"Frogs: a Chorus of Colors\", \"The Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Exhibition\", and \"The Scoop on Poop: The Science of What Animals Leave Behind.\"\nPublic programs\nFestivals\nFour weekend festivals organized around scientific disciplines, are held during the year. Paleopalooza, held in mid-February, features fossil collections and talks by leading paleontologists. Earth Day Festival, held in mid-April, features scientists from the Academy's Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Bug Fest, held in mid August, features entomologists, insect collections and live insects. The Philadelphia Shell Show, held in mid-October, features an international shell market and competitive shell displays.\nPrograms for adults\nThe Academy began offering lectures to the public as early as the 1820s. Current offerings include natural history author talks, lectures by scientists, workshops and classes. In addition, the Center for Environmental Policy produces public programs on environmental issues.\nPrograms for families and children\nSince its Nature Club in the 1930s, the Academy has offered programming just for children. Several programs appropriate for different age groups are currently offered. Safari Overnight sleepovers (camp-ins) are held on selected weekends during Fall, Winter, and Spring. Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts can participate in day workshops and sleepovers to fulfill badge and pin requirements. Tiny Tot Explorers is a program for toddlers. A new series of Family Workshops designed for both adults and children was launched in early 2010.\n\"Wild Weekends\", held on selected weekends throughout the year, offer a variety of children's programs, including hands-on exploration of museum specimens, crafts and live animal shows with mammals, birds and reptiles. Live animal shows are also presented at regular times on other days and featured prominently in the educational programs.\nEducational programs\nField Trips and Outreach\nField Trips to the Academy are available throughout the year for schools, summer camps and other groups. Optional directed programs include Discovery Lessons for younger age groups (pre-K and higher) and Science Explorers for older children (grades 7 through 9). \"Academy on the Go\" is an educational outreach program that visits schools, camps, and community centers.\nWomen in Natural Sciences\nWINS (Women in Natural Sciences) is an innovative and successful science enrichment program conducted by The Academy of Natural Sciences in collaboration with the School District of Philadelphia. Since its founding in 1982, WINS has been providing female public school students with hands-on science classes, scientific literacy and skill-building activities, and opportunities for personal growth in a uniquely nurturing setting.\nOther programs\nAcademy Explorers Camp is a day camp program offered during Spring Break and the Summer. The George Washington Carver Science Fair is held in February or March. Science fair participants are eligible for the George Washington Carver Scholars summer program, which is also held at the Academy. Educator workshops are held throughout the year. The most recent series covered the integration of science and literacy skills. Self-guided workbooks tailored for younger children are available for some of the museum exhibits.\nAwards and research opportunities\nHayden Memorial Geological Award\nThe Hayden Memorial Geological Award is given to prominent scientists working in geology or paleontology. It was established in 1888 in memory of Ferdinand V. Hayden, a distinguished American geologist and pioneering surveyor of the American West who had extensive ties to the Academy.\nGold Medal for Distinction in Natural History Art\nEstablished in 1980, the Gold Medal for Distinction in Natural History Art is awarded to people whose artistic endeavors and life's work have contributed to our understanding and appreciation of living things.\nThe recipients as of 2015 are:[23]\n1980: Roger Tory Peterson\n1981: Ansel Adams\n1982: Sir Peter Scott\n1983: Eliot Porter\n1984: Peter Matthiessen\n1987: BBC Natural History Unit\n1992: William Cooper\n1995: Guy Tudor\n2005: John McPhee\n2007: Ray Troll\n2012: James Prosek[24][25]\nRichard Hopper Day Memorial Medal\nThe Richard Hopper Day Memorial Medal, established in 1960 by his granddaughter, Margaret Day Dilks, is awarded in recognition of outstanding contributions in interpreting the natural sciences to the public.

{"question":"How many strings does a lute have?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1,9424,-1],"passage_indices":[0,15,15],"start_positions":[-1,9336,-1],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","NONE","NONE"]},"context":["\n\n\n\nA lute  (\/lju\u02d0t\/)[1] is any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back enclosing a hollow cavity, usually with a sound hole or opening in the body. More specifically, the term \"lute\" can refer to an instrument from the family of European lutes. The term also refers generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs system). The strings are attached to pegs or posts at the end of the neck, which have some type of turning mechanism to enable the player to tighten the tension on the string or loosen the tension before playing (which respectively raise or lower the pitch of a string), so that each string is tuned to a specific pitch (or note). The lute is plucked or strummed with one hand while the other hand \"frets\" (presses down) the strings on the neck's fingerboard. By pressing the strings on different places of the fingerboard, the player can shorten or lengthen the part of the string that is vibrating, thus producing higher or lower pitches (notes).\nThe European lute and the modern Near-Eastern oud descend from a common ancestor via diverging evolutionary paths. The lute is used in a great variety of instrumental music from the Medieval to the late Baroque eras and was the most important instrument for secular music in the Renaissance.[2] During the Baroque music era, the lute was used as one of the instruments which played the basso continuo accompaniment parts. It is also an accompanying instrument in vocal works. The lute player either improvises (\"realizes\") a chordal accompaniment based on the figured bass part, or plays a written-out accompaniment (both music notation and tabulature (\"tab\") are used for lute). As a small instrument, the lute produces a relatively quiet sound. The player of a lute is called a lutenist, lutanist or lutist, and a maker of lutes (or any similar string instrument, or violin family instruments) is referred to as a luthier.\nEtymology\nThe words lute and oud possibly derive from Arabic al-\u02bfoud (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u062f- literally means \"the wood\"). It may refer to the wooden plectrum traditionally used for playing the oud, to the thin strips of wood used for the back, or to the wooden soundboard that distinguished it from similar instruments with skin-faced bodies.[3] Henry George Farmer considers the similitude between al-\u02bf\u016bd and al-\u02bfawda (\"the return\" \u2013 of bliss).[4]\nMany theories have been proposed for the origin of the Arabic name. A music scholar by the name of Eckhard Neubauer suggested that oud may be an Arabic borrowing from the Persian word r\u014dd or r\u016bd, which meant string.[5][6] Another researcher, archaeomusicologist Richard J. Dumbrill, suggests that rud came from the Sanskrit rudr\u012b (\u0930\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0940, meaning \"string instrument\") and transferred to Arabic  and European languages by way of a Semitic language.[7] However, another theory according to Semitic language scholars, is that the Arabic \u02bfoud is derived from Syriac \u02bfoud-a, meaning \"wooden stick\" and \"burning wood\"\u2014cognate to Biblical Hebrew '\u016b\u1e0f, referring to a stick used to stir logs in a fire.[8][9]\nConstruction\n\nSoundboard\nLutes are made almost entirely of wood. The soundboard is a teardrop-shaped thin flat plate of resonant wood (typically spruce). In all lutes the soundboard has a single (sometimes triple) decorated sound hole under the strings called the rose. The sound hole is not open, but rather covered with a grille in the form of an intertwining vine or a decorative knot, carved directly out of the wood of the soundboard.\nThe geometry of the lute soundboard is relatively complex, involving a system of barring that places braces perpendicular to the strings at specific lengths along the overall length of the belly, the ends of which are angled to abut the ribs on either side for structural reasons. Robert Lundberg, in his book Historical Lute Construction, suggests ancient builders placed bars according to whole-number ratios of the scale length and belly length. He further suggests the inward bend of the soundboard (the \"belly scoop\") is a deliberate adaptation by ancient builders to afford the lutenist's right hand more space between the strings and soundboard.\nSoundboard thickness varies, but generally hovers between 1.5 and 2mm (0.06\u20130.08in). Some luthiers tune the belly as they build, removing mass and adapting bracing to produce desirable sonic results. The lute belly is almost never finished, but in some cases the luthier may size the top with a very thin coat of shellac or glair to help keep it clean. The belly joins directly to the rib, without a lining glued to the sides, and a cap and counter cap are glued to the inside and outside of the bottom end of the bowl to provide rigidity and increased gluing surface.\nAfter joining the top to the sides, a half-binding is usually installed around the edge of the soundboard. The half-binding is approximately half the thickness of the soundboard and is usually made of a contrasting color wood. The rebate for the half-binding must be extremely precise to avoid compromising structural integrity.\nBack\nThe back or the shell is assembled from thin strips of hardwood (maple, cherry, ebony, rosewood, gran, wood and\/or other tonewoods) called ribs, joined (with glue) edge to edge to form a deep rounded body for the instrument. There are braces inside on the soundboard to give it strength.[10]\nNeck\nThe neck is made of light wood, with a veneer of hardwood (usually ebony) to provide durability for the fretboard beneath the strings. Unlike most modern stringed instruments, the lute's fretboard is mounted flush with the top. The pegbox for lutes before the Baroque era was angled back from the neck at almost 90\u00b0 (see image), presumably to help hold the low-tension strings firmly against the nut which, traditionally, is not glued in place but is held in place by string pressure only. The tuning pegs are simple pegs of hardwood, somewhat tapered, that are held in place by friction in holes drilled through the pegbox.\nAs with other instruments that use friction pegs, the wood for the pegs is crucial. As the wood suffers dimensional changes through age and loss of humidity, it must retain a reasonably circular cross-section to function properly\u2014as there are no gears or other mechanical aids for tuning the instrument. Often pegs were made from suitable fruitwoods such as European pearwood, or equally dimensionally stable analogues. Matheson, c. 1720, said, \"If a lute-player has lived eighty years, he has surely spent sixty years tuning.\"\nBridge\nThe bridge, sometimes made of a fruitwood, is attached to the soundboard typically between a fifth and a seventh of the belly length. It does not have a separate saddle but has holes bored into it to which the strings attach directly. The bridge is made so that it tapers in height and length, with the small end holding the trebles and the higher and wider end carrying the basses. Bridges are often colored black with carbon black in a binder, often shellac and often have inscribed decoration. The scrolls or other decoration on the ends of lute bridges are integral to the bridge, and are not added afterwards as on some Renaissance guitars (cf Joachim Tielke's guitars).\nFrets\nThe frets are made of loops of gut tied around the neck. They fray with use, and must be replaced from time to time. A few additional partial frets of wood are usually glued to the body of the instrument, to allow stopping the highest-pitched courses up to a full octave higher than the open string, though these are considered anachronistic by some (though John Dowland and Thomas Robinson describe the practice of gluing wooden frets onto the soundboard). Given the choice between nylon and gut, many luthiers prefer to use gut, as it conforms more readily to the sharp angle at the edge of the fingerboard.\nStrings\nStrings were historically made of animal gut, usually from the small intestine of sheep (sometimes in combination with metal) and are still made of gut or a synthetic substitute, with metal windings on the lower-pitched strings. Modern manufacturers make both gut and nylon strings, and both are in common use. Gut is more authentic for playing period pieces, though unfortunately it is also more susceptible to irregularity and pitch instability due to changes in humidity. Nylon offers greater tuning stability, but is seen as anachronistic by purists, as its timbre differs from the sound of earlier gut strings. Such concerns are moot when more recent compositions for the lute are performed.\nOf note are the catlines used as basses on historical instruments. Catlines are several gut strings wound together and soaked in heavy metal solutions to increase the string mass. Catlines can be quite large in diameter compared to wound nylon strings of the same pitch. They produce a bass that differs somewhat in timbre from nylon basses.\nThe lute's strings are arranged in courses, of two strings each, though the highest-pitched course usually consists of only a single string, called the chanterelle. In later Baroque lutes two upper courses are single. The courses are numbered sequentially, counting from the highest pitched, so that the chanterelle is the first course, the next pair of strings is the second course, etc. Thus an 8-course Renaissance lute usually has 15 strings, and a 13-course Baroque lute has 24.\nThe courses are tuned in unison for high and intermediate pitches, but for lower pitches one of the two strings is tuned an octave higher (the course where this split starts changed over the history of the lute). The two strings of a course are virtually always stopped and plucked together, as if a single string\u2014but in rare cases, a piece requires that the two strings of a course be stopped or plucked separately. The tuning of a lute is a complicated issue, described in a section of its own below. The lute's design makes it extremely light for its size.\nHistory and evolution of the lute\n\nFirst lutes\n\nCurt Sachs defined the word lute in the terminology section of The History of Musical Instruments as \"composed of a body, and of a neck which serves both as a handle and as a means of stretching the strings beyond the body.\"[11] His definition focused on body and neck characteristics and not on the way the strings were sounded, so the fiddle counted as a \"bowed lute\".[11] Sachs also distinguished between the \"long-necked lute\" and the short-necked variety.[11] The short necked variety contained most of our modern instruments, \"lutes, guitars, hurdy-gurdies and the entire family of viols and violins.\"[11]\nThe long lutes were the more ancient lutes; the \"Arabic tanb\u016br...faithfully preserved the outer appearance of the ancient lutes of Babylonia and egypt.\"[12] He further categorized long lutes with a \"pierced lute\" and \"long neck lute.\"[11]  The pierced lute had a neck made from a stick that pierced the body (as in the ancient Egyptian long-neck lutes, and the modern African gunbr\u012b).[13] The long lute had an attached nick, and included the sitar, tanbur and tar (dut\u0101r 2 strings, set\u0101r 3 strings, \u010dat\u0101r 4 strings, pan\u010dt\u0101r 5 strings).[11][12]\nSachs' book dates from 1941, and the archaeological evidence available to him placed the early lutes at about 2000 B.C.[14] Discoveries since then have pushed the existence of the lute back to c. 3100 B.C.[15]\nMusicologist Richard Dumbrill today uses the word lute more categorically to discuss instruments that existed millennia before the term \"lute\" was coined.[16] Dumbrill documented more than 3000 years of iconographic evidence for the lutes in Mesopotamia, in his book The Archaeomusicology of the Ancient Near East. According to Dumbrill, the lute family included instruments in Mesopotamia prior to 3000BC.[15] He points to a cylinder seal as evidence; dating from c. 3100BC  or earlier (now in the possession of the British Museum) the seal depicts on one side what is thought to be a woman playing a stick \"lute\".[15][17] Like Sachs, Dumbrill saw length as distinguishing lutes, dividing the Mesopotamian lutes into a long variety and a short.[18] His book does not cover the shorter instruments that became the European lute, beyond showing examples of shorter lutes in the ancient world. He focuses on the longer lutes of Mesopotamia,  various types of necked chordophones that developed throughout ancient world: Greek, Egyptian (in the Middle Kingdom), Iranian (Elamite and others), Hittite, Roman, Bulgar, Turkic, Indian, Chinese, Armenian\/Cilician cultures. He names among the long lutes, the pandura and the tanbur[19]\nThe line of short-necked lutes was further developed to the east of Mesopotamia, in Bactria and Gandhara, into a short, almond-shaped lute.[3][20][21] Curt Sachs talked about the depictions of Gandharan lutes in art, where they are presented in a mix of \"Northwest Indian art\" under \"a strong Greek influences.\"[22] The short-necked lutes in these Gandhara artworks were \"the venerable ancestor of the Islamic, the Sino-Japanese and the European lute families.\"[22] He described the Gandhara lutes as having a \"pear-shaped body tapering towards the short neck, a frontal stringholder, lateral pegs, and either four or five strings.\"[22]\nPersian barbat, Arab oud\n\nBactria and Gandhara became part of the Sasanian Empire (224\u2013651). Under the Sasanians, a short almond shaped lute from Bactria came to be called the barbat or barbud, which was developed into the later Islamic world's oud or ud.[23] When the Moors conquered Andalusia in 711, they brought their ud or quitra along, into a country that had already known a lute tradition under the Romans, the pandura.\nDuring the 8th and 9th centuries, many musicians and artists from across the Islamic world flocked to Iberia.[24]  Among them was Abu l-Hasan 'Ali Ibn Nafi' (789\u2013857),[25][26] a prominent musician who had trained under Ishaq al-Mawsili (d. 850) in Baghdad and was exiled to Andalusia before 833 AD. He taught and has been credited with adding a fifth string to his oud[23] and with establishing one of the first schools of music in C\u00f3rdoba.[27]\nBy the 11th century, Muslim Iberia had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually to Provence, influencing French troubadours and trouv\u00e8res and eventually reaching the rest of Europe. While Europe developed the lute, the oud remained a central part of Arab music, and broader Ottoman music as well, undergoing a range of transformations.[28]\nAlthough the major entry of the short lute was in western Europe, leading to a variety of lute styles, the short lute entered Europe in the East as well; as early as the sixth century, the Bulgars brought the short-necked variety of the instrument called Komuz to the Balkans.\nBeside the introduction of the lute to Spain (Andalusia) by the Moors,  another important point of transfer of the lute from Arabian to European culture was Sicily, where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians.[29] There were singer-lutenists at the court in Palermo following the Norman conquest of the island from the Muslims, and the lute is depicted extensively in the ceiling paintings in the Palermo's royal Cappella Palatina, dedicated by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily in 1140.[29] His Hohenstaufen grandson Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (1194\u20131250) continued integrating Muslims into his court,  including Moorish musicians.[30] By the fourteenth century, lutes had disseminated throughout Italy and, probably because of the cultural influence of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperor, based in Palermo, the lute had also made significant inroads into the German-speaking lands.\nFrom Middle Ages to Baroque\n\nMedieval lutes were 4- or 5-course instruments, plucked using a quill as a plectrum. There were several sizes, and by the end of the Renaissance, seven different sizes (up to the great octave bass) are documented. Song accompaniment was probably the lute's primary function in the Middle Ages, but very little music securely attributable to the lute survives from the era before 1500. Medieval and early-Renaissance song accompaniments were probably mostly improvised, hence the lack of written records.\nIn the last few decades of the fifteenth century, to play Renaissance polyphony on a single instrument, lutenists gradually abandoned the quill in favor of plucking the instrument with the fingertips. The number of courses grew to six and beyond. The lute was the premier solo instrument of the sixteenth century, but continued to accompany singers as well.\nIn about the year 1500 many Iberian lutenists adopted vihuela de mano, a viol-shaped instrument tuned like the lute, but both instruments continued in coexistence. This instrument also found its way to parts of Italy that were under Spanish domination (especially Sicily and the papal states under the Borgia pope Alexander VI who brought many Catalan musicians to Italy), where it was known as the viola da mano.\nBy the end of the Renaissance the number of courses had grown to ten, and during the Baroque era the number continued to grow until it reached 14 (and occasionally as many as 19). These instruments, with up to 26\u201335 strings, required innovations in the structure of the lute. At the end of the lute's evolution the archlute, theorbo and torban had long extensions attached to the main tuning head to provide a greater resonating length for the bass strings, and since human fingers are not long enough to stop strings across a neck wide enough to hold 14 courses, the bass strings were placed outside the fretboard, and were played open, i.e., without pressing them against the fingerboard with the left hand.\nOver the course of the Baroque era the lute was increasingly relegated to the continuo accompaniment, and was eventually superseded in that role by keyboard instruments. The lute almost fell out of use after 1800. Some sorts of lute were still used for some time in Germany, Sweden, Ukraine.\nGallery\n\nAncient Greek (Tanagra) terracotta statuette depicting a player of the pandura, second century BC\n A stele from Augusta Emerita for a Roman boy, with pandurium, 2nd Century A.D; Museo Arqueologico, Merida, Spain.[31]\nChristian and Muslim playing lute, miniature from Cantigas de Santa Maria by king Alfonso X. 13th century.\nAngel Playing Lute by Vittore Carpaccio (from Presentation of Jesus in the Temple 1510)\nFrans Hals: Buffoon playing a lute, 1623.\nA reconstruction of a 6 course early renaissance lute built by Jo Dusepo.\n\nLute in the modern world\nThe lute enjoyed a revival with the awakening of interest in historical music around 1900 and throughout the century. That revival was further boosted by the early music movement in the twentieth century. Important pioneers in lute revival were Julian Bream, Hans Neemann, Walter Gerwig, Suzanne Bloch and Diana Poulton. Lute performances are now not uncommon; there are many professional lutenists, especially in Europe where the most employment is found, and new compositions for the instrument are being produced by composers.\n\nDuring the early days of the early music movement, many lutes were constructed by available luthiers, whose specialty was often classical guitars. Such lutes were heavily built with construction similar to classical guitars, with fan bracing, heavy tops, fixed frets, and lined sides, all of which are anachronistic to historical lutes. As lutherie scholarship increased, makers began constructing instruments based on historical models, which have proven lighter and more responsive instruments.\nLutes built at present are invariably replicas or near copies of those surviving historical instruments that are in museums or private collections. Many are custom-built, but there is a growing number of luthiers who build lutes for general sale, and there is a fairly strong, if small, second-hand  market. Due to this fairly limited market, lutes are generally more expensive than mass-produced modern instruments: factory-made guitars and violins, for example, can be purchased more cheaply than low-end lutes, but at the highest level of modern instruments, guitars and violins tend to command higher prices than lutes.\nUnlike in the past there are many types of lutes encountered today: 5-course medieval lutes, renaissance lutes of 6 to 10 courses in many pitches for solo and ensemble performance of Renaissance works, the archlute of Baroque works, 11-course lutes in d-minor tuning for 17th-century French, German and Czech music, 13\/14-course d-minor tuned German Baroque Lutes for later High Baroque and Classical music, theorbo for basso continuo parts in Baroque ensembles, gallichons\/mandoras, bandoras, orpharions and others.\nLutenistic practice has reached considerable heights in recent years, thanks to a growing number of world-class lutenists: Rolf Lislevand, Hopkinson Smith, Paul O'Dette, Christopher Wilke, Andreas Martin, Robert Barto, Eduardo Eg\u00fcez, Edin Karamazov, Nigel North, Christopher Wilson, Luca Pianca, Yasunori Imamura, Anthony Bailes, Peter Croton, Xavier Diaz-Latorre. Singer-songwriter Sting has also played lute and archlute, in and out of his collaborations with Edin Karamazov, and Jan Akkerman released two albums of lute music in the 1970s while he was a guitarist in the Dutch rock band Focus. Lutenist\/Composer Jozef van Wissem composed the soundtrack to the Jim Jarmusch film Only Lovers Left Alive.\nLutes of several regional types are also common in Greece: laouto, and outi.\nRepertoire\n\n\nLutes were in widespread use in Europe at least since the 13th century, and documents mention numerous early performers and composers. However, the earliest surviving lute music dates from the late 15th century. Lute music flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries: numerous composers published collections of their music, and modern scholars have uncovered a vast number of manuscripts from the era\u2014however, much of the music is still lost. In the second half of the 17th century lutes, vihuelas and similar instruments started losing popularity, and almost no music had been written for the instrument after 1750. The interest in lute music was revived only in the second half of the 20th century.\nImprovisation (making up music on the spot) was, apparently, an important aspect of lute performance, so much of the repertoire was probably never written down. Furthermore, it was only around 1500 that lute players began to transition from plectrum to plucking. That change facilitated complex polyphony, which required that they develop notation. In the next hundred years, three schools of tablature notation gradually developed: Italian (also used in Spain), German, and French. Only the last survived into the late 17th century. The earliest known tablatures are for a six-stringed instrument, though evidence of earlier four- and five-stringed lutes exists.[32] Tablature notation depends on the actual instrument the music is written for. To read it, a musician must know the instrument's tuning, number of strings, etc.\nRenaissance and Baroque forms of lute music are similar to keyboard music of the periods. Intabulations of vocal works were very common, as well as various dances, some of which disappeared during the 17th century, such as the piva and the saltarello. The advent of polyphony brought about fantasias: complex, intricate pieces with much use of imitative counterpoint. The improvisatory element, present to some degree in most lute pieces, is particularly evident in the early ricercares (not imitative as their later namesakes, but completely free), as well as in numerous preludial forms: preludes, tastar de corde (\"testing the strings\"), etc. During the 17th century keyboard and lute music went hand in hand, and by 1700 lutenists were writing suites of dances quite akin to those of keyboard composers. The lute was also used throughout its history as an ensemble instrument\u2014most frequently in songs for voice and lute, which were particularly popular in Italy (see frottola) and England.\nThe earliest surviving lute music is Italian, from a late 15th-century manuscript. The early 16th century saw Petrucci's publications of lute music by Francesco Spinacino (fl. 1507) and Joan Ambrosio Dalza (fl. 1508); together with the so-called Capirola Lutebook, these represent the earliest stage of written lute music in Italy. The leader of the next generation of Italian lutenists, Francesco Canova da Milano (1497\u20131543), is now acknowledged as one of the most famous lute composers in history. The bigger part of his output consists of pieces called fantasias or ricercares, in which he makes extensive use of imitation and sequence, expanding the scope of lute polyphony. In the early 17th century Johannes Hieronymus Kapsberger (c. 1580\u20131651) and Alessandro Piccinini (1566\u20131638) revolutionized the instrument's technique and Kapsberger, possibly, influenced the keyboard music of Frescobaldi.\nFrench written lute music began, as far as we know, with Pierre Attaingnant's (c. 1494 \u2013 c. 1551) prints, which comprised preludes, dances and intabulations. Particularly important was the Italian composer Albert de Rippe (1500\u20131551), who worked in France and composed polyphonic fantasias of considerable complexity. His work was published posthumously by his pupil, Guillaume de Morlaye (born c. 1510), who, however, did not pick up the complex polyphony of de Rippe. French lute music declined during the second part of the 16th century; however, various changes to the instrument (the increase of diapason strings, new tunings, etc.) prompted an important change in style that led, during the early Baroque, to the celebrated style bris\u00e9: broken, arpeggiated textures that influenced Johann Jakob Froberger's suites. The French Baroque school is exemplified by composers such as Ennemond Gaultier (1575\u20131651), Denis Gaultier (1597\/1603\u20131672), Fran\u00e7ois Dufaut (before 1604\u2013before 1672) and many others. The last stage of French lute music is exemplified by Robert de Vis\u00e9e (c. 1655\u20131732\/3), whose suites exploit the instrument's possibilities to the fullest.\nThe history of German written lute music started with Arnolt Schlick (c. 1460\u2013after 1521), who, in 1513, published a collection of pieces that included 14 voice and lute songs, and three solo lute pieces, alongside organ works. He was not the first important German lutenist, because contemporaries credited Conrad Paumann (c. 1410\u20131473) with the invention of German lute tablature, though this claim remains unproven, and no lute works by Paumann survive. After Schlick, a string of composers developed German lute music: Hans Judenk\u00fcnig (c. 1445\/50\u20131526), the Neusidler family (particularly Hans Neusidler (c. 1508\/09\u20131563)) and others. During the second half of the 16th century, German tablature and German repertoire were gradually replaced by Italian and French tablature and international repertoire, respectively, and the Thirty Years War (1618\u201348) effectively stopped publications for half a century. German lute music was revived much later by composers such as Esaias Reusner (fl. 1670), however, a distinctly German style came only after 1700 in the works of Silvius Leopold Weiss (1686\u20131750), one of the greatest lute composers, some of whose works were transcribed for keyboard by none other than Johann Sebastian Bach (1685\u20131750), who composed a few pieces for the lute himself (though it is unclear whether they were really intended for the lute, rather than another plucked string instrument or the lautenwerk).\nOf other European countries, particularly important are England and Spain. English written lute music only began around 1540, however, the country produced numerous lutenists, of which John Dowland (1563\u20131626) is perhaps the most famous. His influence spread very far: variations on his themes were written by keyboard composers in Germany decades after his death. Dowland's predecessors and colleagues, such as Anthony Holborne (c. 1545\u20131602) and Daniel Bacheler (1572\u20131619), were less known. Spanish composers wrote mostly for the vihuela; their main genres were polyphonic fantasias and differencias (variations). Luys Milan (c.1500\u2013after 1560) and Luys de Narv\u00e1ez (fl. 1526\u201349) were particularly important for their contributions to the development of lute polyphony in Spain. Finally, perhaps the most influential European lute composer was the Hungarian B\u00e1lint Bakfark (c. 1526\/30\u20131576), whose contrapuntal fantasias were much more difficult and tighter than those of his Western European contemporaries.\n\n\n20th century revival and composers\nThe revival of lute-playing in the 20th century has its roots in the pioneering work of Arnold Dolmetsch (1858\u20131940); whose research into early music and instruments started the movement for authenticity.[33]  The revival of the lute gave composers an opportunity to create new works for it.\nOne of the first such composers was Johann Nepomuk David in Germany. Composer Vladimir Vavilov was a pioneer of the lute revival in the USSR, he was also the author of numerous musical hoaxes. Sandor Kallos and Toyohiko Satoh applied modernist idiom to the lute, Elena Kats-Chernin, Jozef van Wissem and Alexandre Danilevsky minimalist and post-minimalist idiom, Roman Turovsky-Savchuk, Paulo Galv\u00e3o, Robert MacKillop historicist idiom, and Ronn McFarlane New Age. This active movement by early music specialists has inspired composers in different fields; for example, in 1980, Akira Ifukube, a classical and film composer best known for the Godzilla's theme, wrote the Fantasia for Baroque Lute with the historical tablature notation, rather than the modern staff one.[34]\nTuning conventions\n\n\n\n\nLutes were made in a large variety of sizes, with varying numbers of strings\/courses, and with no permanent standard for tuning. However, the following seems to have been generally true of the Renaissance lute.\nA 6-course Renaissance tenor lute would be tuned to the same intervals as a tenor viol, with intervals of a perfect fourth between all the courses except the third and fourth, which differed only by a major third. The tenor lute was usually tuned nominally \"in G\" (there was no pitch standard before the 20th century), named after the pitch of the highest course, yielding the pattern (G'G) (Cc) (FF) (AA) (dd) (g) from the lowest course to the highest. (Much renaissance lute music can be played on a guitar by tuning the guitar's third string down by a half tone.)\nFor lutes with more than six courses the extra courses would be added on the low end. Because of the large number of strings, lutes have very wide necks, and it is difficult to stop strings beyond the sixth course, so additional courses were usually tuned to pitches useful as bass notes rather than continuing the regular pattern of fourths, and these lower courses are most often played without stopping. Thus an 8-course tenor Renaissance lute would be tuned to (D'D) (F'F) (G'G) (Cc) (FF) (AA) (dd) (g), and a 10-course to (C'C) (D'D) (E\u266d'E\u266d) (F'F) (G'G) (Cc) (FF) (AA) (dd) (g).\nHowever, none of these patterns were de rigueur, and a modern lutenist occasionally retunes one or more courses between pieces. Manuscripts bear instructions for the player, e.g., 7e ch\u0153ur en fa = \"seventh course in fa\" (= F in the standard C scale).\nThe first part of the seventeenth century was a period of considerable diversity in the tuning of the lute, particularly in France. However, by around 1670 the scheme known today as the \"Baroque\" or \"D minor\" tuning became the norm, at least in France and in northern and central Europe. In this case the first six courses outline a d-minor triad, and an additional five to seven courses are tuned generally scalewise below them. Thus the 13-course lute played by composer Sylvius Leopold Weiss would have been tuned (A\u2033A') (B\u2033B') (C'C) (D'D) (E'E) (F'F) (G'G) (A'A') (DD) (FF) (AA) (d) (f), or with sharps or flats on the lower 7 courses appropriate to the key of the piece.[35]\nModern lutenists tune to a variety of pitch standards, ranging from A = 392 to 470Hz, depending on the type of instrument they are playing, the repertory, the pitch of other instruments in an ensemble and other performing expediencies. No attempt at a universal pitch standard existed during the period of the lute's historical popularity. The standards varied over time and from place to place.\nSee also\nInstruments\n\n\n\nEuropean Lutes:\nString instruments\nAng\u00e9lique\nArchlute\nCobza\nGallichon\nKobza\nMandore\nMandora\nSwedish lute\nTablature\nTorban\nTheorbo\nVihuela\nEarly music\nMedieval music\nRenaissance music\nBaroque music\nClassical music\nTurkish music\nGreek music\nCretan music\nAfrican Lutes:\nGonje\nXalam\nAsian Lutes:\nBarbat\nBiwa\nDombra\nDotar\nDramnyen\nKomuz\nKutiyapi\nOud\nPipa\nQinqin\nRubab\nSapeh\nSetar\nSitar\nTanbur\nTar\nVeena\nYueqin\nStringed instrument tunings\nComposers of lute music\nCategory:Composers for lute\nList of composers for lute\nLute players\nRobert Barto\nTimothy Burris\nJohann Georg Hamann\nLutz Kirchhof\nRolf Lislevand\nNigel North\nPaul O'Dette\nBen Salfield\nHopkinson Smith\nJozef van Wissem\nEduardo Eguez\n\nLute makers\nCezar Mateus\nStephen Murphy\nDavid Rubio\nAndrew Rutherford\nAntonio Stradivari\nJoachim Tielke\nNotes\n\n\nThe Lute in Europe by Andreas Schlegel, published by  (2006).

{"question":"When was the first automated pool cleaner developed?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1,2478,1761],"passage_indices":[-1,3,1],"start_positions":[-1,2474,1757],"yes_no_answer":["NONE","NONE","NONE"]},"context":["\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn automated pool cleaner is a vacuum cleaner intended to collect debris and sediment from swimming pools with minimal human intervention. Popularly dubbed a ''creepy-crawly'' or \"Kreepy Krauly\" in South Africa,[1] it is one of several types of swimming pool vacuum cleaners. Other major types are battery-powered or manually powered wands effective only for very small pools, kiddie or wading pools and small spas and hot tubs, and battery-powered, handheld\/extended reach pool and spa vacuums. The latter are powered by rechargeable batteries and can be hand held attached to a telescopic pole used for extended reach. These are used for small to medium-sized pools, larger spas, and to spot clean larger pools.[2] The name ''creepy-crawly'' derives from the vacuum's webbed-nozzle crawling creepily through the underwater mist as well as for its creepy suction noise. ''Creepy crawly'' originally referred to strange creatures that crawl on the bottom of the ocean, as the webbed nozzle of the vacuum slightly resembles an octopus in both appearance and suction ability.\nHistory\nEvolution\nSwimming pool cleaners evolved from two areas of science: development of the water filter and early cistern cleaners.\nThe forerunner of today's pool cleaners were cistern cleaners. A cistern (Middle English cisterne, from the Latin cisterna, from cista, box, from Greek kist\u00ea, basket) is a waterproof receptacle for holding liquids, usually water. Often cisterns were and still are built to catch and store rainwater. The great palaces of antiquity had both lavish pools and cisterns. They were prevalent in early America as well. United States Patent and Trademark Office makes reference to a cistern cleaner patent filed (though never issued) as early as 1798. Before swimming pools were affordable and fashionable, many swam in their larger cisterns.\nIn 1883 John E. Pattison of New Orleans filed an application for a \"Cistern and Tank Cleaner \" and the first discovered patent was issued the following year.[3]  It swept and scraped the bottom of a cistern or tank, and through a combination of suction and manipulation of the water pressure was able to separate and remove sediment without removing the water. Over the next 20 years his invention was improved on numerous occasions. Many pool cleaner patents issued in the modern era refer to some of the cistern cleaners as predecessors of their invention.\nEarly models\nThe first swimming pool cleaner was invented in 1912 by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania local citizen John M. Davison. On November 26, 1912, he submitted a patent application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office entitled \"Cleaning Apparatus For Swimming Pools And The Like,\" patent number 1,056,779 that was issued on March 25, 1913.[4]\nThe first suction-side pool cleaner was invented by Roy B. Everson of Chicago in 1937, which he entitled \"Swimming Pool Cleaner\".[5]\nNineteen years later, the first suction-side pool cleaner was the work of Joseph Eistrup of San Mateo, California, who called his invention simply \"Pool Cleaner\".[6]\nTwo years later, the first truly automatic, aptly named \"Automatic Swimming Pool Cleaner\" was created by Andrew L. Pansini of Greenbrae, California, founder of the industry icon Jandy Corporation. Patent Number 3,032,044 was touted by Pansini as \"an automatic swimming pool cleaner\", which is effective to remove the scum, dirt and other accumulations from both the bottom and side walls of a pool to disperse foreign matter in the, water for removal therefrom by normal pump-filter system of the pool.[7]\nThe first robotic pool cleaner that used electricity was the work of Robert B. Myers of Boca Raton, Florida in 1967, who filed a patent.[8]\nThe third and last of the generally accepted pool cleaner technologies, the pressure-side cleaner, was invented by Melvyn L. Henkin of Tarzana, California in 1972. His \"Automatic Swimming Pool Cleaner[9], United States Patent Number 3,822,754 utilized three wheels to allow the machine \"to travel underwater along a random path on the pool vessel surface for dislodging debris therefrom\". The design is probably familiar to pool owners as the Polaris Pool Cleaner.[10]\nIndependently from his American counterparts Ferdinand Chauvier invented the Kreepy Krauly in South Africa in 1974 in Springs.[11]\nTypes\nThere are three main types of automated or automatic swimming pool cleaners, classified by the drive mechanism and source of power used:\nSuction-side\nIn this type, water pumped out of the pool via its skimmer or drains is used for locomotion and debris suction and returned after being filtered via pool return or outlet valves. This is the least expensive and most popular type. It traces a random course. This type of cleaner is usually attached via a 1.5 inch hose to a vacuum plate in the skimmer, or to a dedicated extraction or \"vac\" line on the side of the pool. The suction action of the pool's pump provides motive force to  the machine to randomly traverse the floor and walls of the pool, extracting dirt and debris in its path. The first automatic pool cleaner was a suction cleaner.\nThese are the least expensive and most widely used pool cleaners with purchase costs ranging in the $100\u2013$300 price range. They are powered solely by the main pump of the pool and utilize the pool's filter system to remove dirt and debris from the water. These machines effectively diminish the suction of the main pump - using them will increase the electricity costs and require the main pump and filter system to be serviced more frequently. There is minimal maintenance and part replacement costs on these devices over time.\nPressure-side\nIn this design, pool water inflow is further pressurized using a secondary \"booster\" pump on most but not all models. This high-pressure water is used for locomotion and debris suction, employing the venturi effect. It traces a random course. The requirement of a booster pump makes this type the highest in  electricity use of the three types of pool cleaners.\nThe pressure causes turbulence in the water, distributing some debris on the floor and walls of the pool, some of which is re-floated to the pool surface and then sucked into the main filter through the skimmer inlets. A portion of the dirt and debris is caught in an attached filter bag. The purchase cost of this type of cleaner range from a minimum of $200 to about $700 plus the costs of the booster pump, usually over $200. Some more sophisticated models can cost over $1,000.\nBoth suction-side and pressure-side cleaners are dependent on the pool's main pump and filter system to remove contaminants from the pool water, so cannot remove particles smaller than the pore size of the pool's existing filter element. Such elements can be made of sand, diatomaceous earth, zeolite or other natural or synthetic materials. That particle size ranges from under 5\u00b5m for diatomaceous filters to well in excess of 50\u00b5m for sand filters. Disadvantages of these types of pool cleaners are the additional electricity use, and filtration limitation by the pore size of the main filter element, as well as the time and effort needed to attach the device to the ports that connect to the main pump and filter, and the increased burden of maintenance time and expense on the pool's mechanics.\nElectric robotic\nThese cleaners are independent from the pool's main filter and pump system and are powered by a separate electricity source, usually in the form of a set-down transformer that is kept at least 10 feet (3.0m) from the water in the pool, often on the pool deck. They have two internal motors: one to suck in water through a self-contained filter bag and then return the filtered water at a high rate of speed back into the pool water. The second is a drive motor that is connected to tractor-like rubber or synthetic tracks and \"brushes\" connected by rubber or plastic bands via a metal shaft. The brushes, resembling paint rollers, are located on the front and back of the machine and help remove contaminating particles from the pool's floor, walls (and in some designs even the pool steps) depending on size and configuration. They also direct the particles into the internal filter bag.\nAn internal microchip is pre-programmed to turn on and off and reverse the direction of the drive motors. The chip will cause the machine to change direction when it reaches a wall or the water surface after climbing the pool walls.\nThese machines may also be directed by sensors located in the bump bars which, on contact with objects such as a wall, cause a reverse in direction, with a small offset allowing it to move one machine's width over on each crossing of the pool. The delay timer is an important feature for many pools, as many switch off a number of circulation pumps during the night to allow suspended particles to settle on the bottom of the pool; after a couple of hours the pool cleaner begins its cleaning cycle. This cleaning cycle is set up to complete before the pumps are turned back on. Though not necessary for adequate pool cleaning, this feature saves energy and improves cleaning efficiency.\nIn order to move forward and backward and negotiate walls and steps electric robotic cleaners rely on three natural principles, traction and movement caused by the drive motor and tracks, buoyancy created by the large areas inside the machine that fills with air, and the force resulting from the high pressure of water being emitted from the top of the machine that pushes it against the floor and walls. Some electric robotic machines use brushes made out of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) Polyvinyl alcohol that has an adherence quality that allows the unit to almost cling to the walls, steps and floors. They also are resistant to dirt and oil improving lifespan over rubber or other synthetic materials.\nThe combination of these three natural principles along with an internal mercury switch that tells the microchip that the unit has gone from a horizontal to vertical position as it climbs a wall allows it to change direction from ascending to descending the wall at pre-programmed intervals based on the average height of a pool walls. Some machines have delayed timers that cause the robot to remain at the water line, where more dirt accumulates, for momentarily resulting in a scrubbing action, much like the wheels of a powerful automobile spinning or peeling out.\nThe major benefits of these machines are efficiency in time, energy, and cleaning ability as well as low maintenance requirements and costs. The major disadvantage is purchase cost which can range from $500 for floor-cleaning-only machines to over $2,000 for the most sophisticated residential units.\nCommercial versions\nAccording to P.K. Data of Duluth, a Georgia consulting and market research firm that has been retained for many years by the pool and spa industry's internal trade organization, The Association of Pool & Spa Professionals (APSP) there are approximately 14,000,000 residential pools and spas in the United States and over 400,000 commercial or public pools. As a result, this has created a market for larger, more powerful commercial pool cleaners. All commercial pool cleaners are electric robotic and can range in price from a little over $1,000 to upwards of $15,000 or more. They closely resemble residential models but in addition to their addition size they are made with heavy duty components and often more sophisticated computer guidance and on and off systems.\nControlling legislation\nThere have been attempts for nearly 100 years to mandate the use of pool cleaners, primarily addressed to public pools. Currently the Center for Disease Control and Prevention located in the Greater Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area on a grant provided by the National Swimming Pool Foundation (NSPF) is about to publish the first uniform Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC). Included is a section on pool filtration proposed regulations directed to the nation's 3200+ state and local agencies that enforce laws and ordinances relating to the operation of swimming pools and spas.\nHistorical perspective\nThe proposed MAHC is not the first attempt to propose a uniform aquatic health code. The credit for that goes to the American Public Health Association(APHA) which 100 years ago recognized the dangers of improperly maintained aquatic facilities and formed a committee in 1918 that, for the next 66 years, issued eleven so-called \"Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places Standards For Design, Construction, Equipment And Operation\" recommended ordinances and regulations. But for a variety of reasons none of these recommendations were adopted, at least not formally or completely adopted.\nUniform Aquatic Health Code\nThe APHA has tried to develop a uniform aquatic health code, or what it referred to for years as referenced above, and published short reports annually from 1920 through 1925 that it simply referred to as \"Report of the Committee On Bathing Places\". and finally in 1926 [12] published in its journal its first comprehensive report it called \"Standards for Design, Construction, Equipment and Operation\" for \"Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places\". Twelve others were published through 1981. However, its lack of authority to enforce them is implied by the changing description of what was limited to their recommendations or suggestions and the expressed purposes in issuing them.\nReports\nIn 1957, it referred to its report as \"Recommended Practice for Design, Equipment and Operation of Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places\".[13]\nIn the most comprehensive one since 1926 and until it stopped issuing them in 1981 it referred in 1964 to its report as \"Suggested Ordinance and Regulations Covering Public Swimming Pools\" and in 1970 one for \"Private Swimming Pools\". Its last report in 1981 was called \"Public Swimming Pools: Recommended Regulations for Design and Construction, Operation and Maintenance\". In 1926 appears the committee believed its standards would be adopted by the empowered jurisdictions, although who they were never mentioned in the report.\nIn 1964 the boldest move of all took place as it presented its recommendations in the form of proposed ordinances and regulations and in the Forward concluded: \"State and local governments who desire to enact this Suggested Ordinance and Regulations Covering Public Swimming Pools a useful resource\".\nNew York City Meeting, 1912\nIn 1912, coincidentally the same year when the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the first patent for a swimming pool cleaner, the Sanitary Engineering Section of the American Public Health Association (APHA) convened in New York City to lay the groundwork for the first recommended pool and spa regulations. As reported in the American Journal of Public Health in April 1912 a meeting was held in Havana the previous December and at the New York meeting among the subjects that the committee was to be studying was \"Hygiene of swimming pools\".[14]\nSix years later a committee on swimming pools was appointed at the APHA's annual meeting in Chicago and in 1920 a similar committee was appointed at the meeting in Washington, D.C. In 1921 and periodically over the next seven decades until the work of the APHA on this subject matter went through a series of divisions and consolidations, diverted elsewhere its committees and joint committees with other health-orientated public and quasi-public organizations issued proposed ordinances and regulations in the form of unenforceable recommendations. Despite their intended and published goals, none became law, uniform, much less national.[15]\nNone of the proposed Standards included more than a passing reference of the need to properly clean a pool. A few, but curiously not all of these recommended ordinances and regulations, related to the use of a vacuum, although the first that included any specificity in 1923 at least required a certain level of clarity. The 1921 report, barely a few pages in length, made this reference to the need to clean the pool.\nPool cleaning is done by completely emptying the pool an average of twice weekly and scrubbing with stiff brushes and soap. Hose flushing follows the scrubbing. After the flushing outlet is opened, the well turned on and clean water allowed to water over the floor of the drains, etc...\n\nThe 1923 report of the American Journal of Public Health, Sanitary Engineering Section American Public Health Association read before the Sanitary Engineering Section of the American Public Health Association at the Fifty-second Annual Meeting at Boston, Massachusetts, October 8, 1923. slightly longer, but still very brief stated:\nSection 3. Clearness: At all times when the pool is in use the water shall be sufficiently clear to permit a black disk six inches in diameter on a white filed, placed on the bottom of the pool at the deepest point, to be clearly visible from both sides of the pool when the water is quiet.\n\nIt further stated:\nNo swimming pool shall be opened to the use of bathers on any day until all visible dirt (not stains) on the bottom of the pool and any visible scum or floating matter on the surface has been removed. Scum and floating matters may be infectious material and should always be removed as soon as possible after they are observed.\n\nTherefore, in 1921 it was recognized that infectious material, namely pathogens collect in the pool and should be removed.\nIt was not until 1926 twelve years after the organization recognized the need to address swimming pool \"hygiene\" and eight years after the committee was organized that the first true report was issued and later published in the Journal of the American Public Health Association. Of all of its reports from 1920 through 1981 the first major report by the APHA the 1926 one, written in narrative form as were the succeeding nine ones though 1957 the committee included the detailed provisions relating to pool cleaning, vacuuming and vacuums:\nE. Suction Cleaner: In the opinion of the committee the only satisfactory method of removing the dirt, hair, etc., settling on the bottom of a pool is by means of a suction cleaner. As such cleaners are commonly operated by the circulation pumps; they may be classed as an adjunct to the recirculation system. When a suction cleaner is to be operated by the recirculation pump, a gate with graduated stem or other registering device should be provided for throttling the flow from the pool outlet to permit the pump to operate at maximum efficiency when the suction cleaner is in use. Fixed pipe connections for attachment of suction cleaner to pump suction should be of ample size to reduce friction to a minimum and the cleaner and all removable connections should be designed to provide a maximum velocity at the suction nozzle.\nXXVI Cleaning Pool\nA. Visible dirt on the bottom of a swimming pool shall not be permitted to remain more than 24 hours.\nB. Any visible scum or floating material on the surface of a pool shat be removed within 24 hours by flushing or other effective means\n\nThe 1964 report included the following language:\nA vacuum-cleaning system shall be provided. When an integral part of the recirculation system, sufficient connections shall be located in the walls of the swimming pool, at least eight inches below the water line and \"Visible dirt on the bottom of the swimming pool shall be removed every 24 hours or more frequently as required. Visible scum or floating matter on the swimming pool surface shall be removed within 24 hours by flushing or other effective means.\n\nThe CDC was founded (in 1946), followed by the Cabinet-level Department of Health, Education and Welfare (in 1953), now the Department of Health, and Human Services and its 11 operating divisions, the National Health Service Corps (in 1977) and along the way a variety of private and non-profit aquatic organizations such as the National Spa and Pool Association (in 1956), now the Association of Pool and Spa Professionals the National Swimming Pool Foundation (in 1965).\nPresently a variety, but not by a long shot the majority, of states and jurisdictions that have codified the requirement of inclusion of an independent vacuum cleaner including the two states with the highest number and concentration of both residential and public pools:\nCalifornia: 2010 Title 24, Part 2, Vol. 2 California Building Code. Section 3140B, Cleaning Systems:\nA vacuum cleaning system shall be available which is capable of removing sediment from all parts of the pool floor. A cleaning system using potable water shall be provided with an approved backflow protection device as required by the California Department of Public Health under Sections 7601 to 7605.\u2014[16]\n\nFlorida:\nFlorida Department of Health section 64E-9.007 Recirculation and Treatment System Requirements\n(12) Cleaning system\u2013 A portable or plumbed in vacuum cleaning system shall be provided. All vacuum pumps shall be equipped with hair and lint strainers. Recirculation or separate vacuum pumps shall not be used for vacuuming purposes when in excess of 3 horsepower. When the system is plumbed in, the vacuum fittings shall be located to allow cleaning the pool with a 50 foot maximum length of hose. Vacuum fittings shall be mounted no more than 15 inches below the water level, flush with the pool walls, and shall be provided with a spring loaded safety cover which shall be in place at all times. Bag type cleaners which operate as ejectors on potable water supply pressure must be protected by a vacuum breaker. Cleaning devices shall not be used while the pool is open to bathers.\u2014[17]\n\nCall to action\nIn 2005 the CDC in response to a growing concern and feared epidemic with the pathogen Cryptosporidium the Center for Disease Control Center for Disease Control, much like the American Public Health Association did in 1912 convened many of the country's foremost medical and other scientific experts to study the concern for aquatic health. As a result, in 2007 they began their quest, again much like the APHC for a uniform aquatic health code.\nEach health and safety segment has been assigned to a committee to study it and draft a proposed module open for public comment before being adopted and then recommended to the nation's 3200+ state and local health agencies that enact ordinances and regulations for swimming pools and spa and other aquatic facilities, inspect and monitor them and then enforce the regulations. Since the focus of the MAHC was to respond to the threat of Cryptosporidium the Technical Committee of Recirculation Systems and Filtration is a major focus. The University of North Carolina Charlotte Associate Professor James Amburgey is the Chairperson of the Center For Disease Control, Model Aquatic Health Code Technical Committee on Recirculation Systems and Filtration.\nAmburgey has conducted many tests to evaluation existing swimming pool filters and his conclusions have been they are extremely ineffective in most cases to help remove Cryptosporidium.[18] He is reported to be working with several manufacturers of swimming pool and spa vacuum cleaners to develop a filter bag that will result in exponential advancements in the current filter bags, cleaners and vacuums on the market.\nSee also\nDomestic robot\nHot tub\nRobotic vacuum cleaner\nSwimming pool\nWater purification\n\n\nFurther reading\nUnited States Swimming Market, 2005, Pool and spa marketing reference directory.
