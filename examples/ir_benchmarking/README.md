# IR Benchmarking

Here we describe the steps for replicating results from the paper, [Moving Beyond Downstream Task Accuracy for Information Retrieval Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01340).

### 1. Setting up Amazon Instance

To get started on an Amazon instance, please go to the [Amazon tutorial for EC2 linux instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html). There are a range of instances to choose from so please choose one with the appropriate memory and GPU resources for running the selected experiments. For example, for our most well-resourced instance, we used `p3.8xlarge`.

When initiating your instance, please select an Ubuntu machine image. This will be helpful for installing Docker and dependencies in later steps.

### 2. Installing Docker

To install Docker, please use the following [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

### 3. Installing dependencies

### 4. Running experiments
