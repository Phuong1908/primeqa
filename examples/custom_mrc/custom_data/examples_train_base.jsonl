{"question":"Can you tour The Ch\u00e2teau de Brest?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1],"passage_indices":[-1],"start_positions":[-1],"yes_no_answer":["NONE"]},"context":["Coordinates: \n\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Brest is a castle in Brest, Finist\u00e8re, France.  The oldest monument in the town, it is located at the mouth of the river Penfeld at the heart of the roadstead of Brest, one of the largest roadsteads in the world.  From the Roman castellum to Vauban's citadel, the site has over 1700 years of history, holding right up to the present day its original role as a military fortress and a strategic location of the highest importance.  It is thus the oldest castle in the world still in use, and was classified as a monument historique on 21 March 1923 .\nThe structure's heterogeneous architecture has been the result of continual adaptations to developments in siege warfare and armament on land and sea. The ch\u00e2teau stands on the opposite bank to the Tour Tanguy combining to defend the entrance to the Penfeld.\n\nAn ideal geographic location\n\nThe Roadstead of Brest, well-protected by a narrow \"goulet\" but sufficiently large to allow ships to turn or move, forms a natural harbour.  Its dimensions make it a small inland sea, capable of receiving the largest fleets.  It is so vast that it offers a protected haven for ships.\nThis haven is fed by the river Penfeld from the north, running off the plateaus of L\u00e9on. Its lower course is winding, with high raised banks that break strong winds.  Even heavy-tonnage vessels can berth safely in this vast and substantial area.  The cape that divides the roadstead from the bay has four sides, three of which are defended by nature and with a fourth side that needs fortification but which is still easily defensible.  This unique site gives the castle major strategic significance\nThe castle was thus built on a rocky outcrop carved out which the river has cut into the cliff at its mouth in the estuary.  Since the place overlooks and dominates the sea, it controls access to the Penfeld and the lower reaches of the Elorn towards Landerneau, all whilst overlooking a major part of the roadstead and its entrance: the Goulet de Brest.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is the only natural port the king has on the ocean sea.  It is so advantageously disposed in all ways that if its location and form had been chosen by his Majesty himself it could not have been wished otherwise.[1]\u201d\nHistory\nOrigins\nThe site was inhabited during the Lower Palaeolithic (300,000 BC) and in the Neolithic agricultural activity occurred on the site. Other coastal populations are known in the 6th and 4th centuries BC and the rocky spur was occupied until the end of the Iron Age.  Its remarkable position allows a hypothesis that the site held a prehistoric fortification, but the first fort of which evidence remains is from the Roman era.\nAround 500 BC, a tribe of merchants and sailors in leather barks known as the Osismii peopled the region.  To them are to be attributed the gold coinage discovered around Brest, as well as a road predating the Roman presence in the area.  The tribe's territory (roughly equivalent to today's Finist\u00e8re) was bordered to the south by the territory of the Veneti and to the east by that of the Curiosolites, with its capital at  and Vorgium (Carhaix).  This end of the world (Finis terrae) only saw Roman occupation very late in the Roman period.\nRoman era\n\n\n\nFrom Roman coinage found on the site, it appears that the Romans were present there at least by the reign of the emperor Septimius Severus (193-211).  The Roman province of Armorica thus had to face Saxon raids.  To face the barbarian invasion threat and the disintegration of the Roman empire, it became necessary to create forts at Brest and several other sites along these coasts.\nThe Romans erected a defensive work at the end of the 3rd century.  This camp or castellum housed 1000 men of a troop, headed by a prefect, as well as a fleet designed to intercept pirate ships.  Only one of its walls now survives - these foundations were encased in the ramparts of the present castle, extending for 120-140m in length, on an average height of 3-4m.\nThese begin from the base of the wall.  In large part interred under the false-wall of the castle or under the carpark, it remains visible at 2-3m high.  Their external appearance is characteristically Roman, with brick and stone alternating in \"opus mixtum\", sometimes arranged in \"fish-bone\" pattern.  This 4m thick fortified wall, with 10 cylindrical towers, defends the point and forms a bar across the spur.  The absence of Roman remains inside the castle suggests it was a purely military work and not also a civil oppidum.  The section of the razed towers at ground level remains visible in the false wall.\nIt seems that the Romans did not entirely complete the fortified wall since their presence here was short-lived.  At this era it is possible that the sea coast was simply defended by a ditch and palisade.  1832 saw the discovery of the foundations of a round tower, Roman in appearance, near what is now the tour de Brest.\nThe wall was certainly completed as a curtain wall on 3 sides, in a regular trapezoid, with 12 turrets on each side.  Another Gallo-Roman remain survives - a 1.4m wide postern, demolished in the Middle Ages (its stones and bricks survive in the tour Madeleine).\nAncient Brest was probably the site known to the Romans as Gesoscribate at the termination point of one of the Armorican roads.\nThe counts of L\u00e9on\nFrom the Romans' departure (410-420) until the 11th century, little is known as to the history of the castellum at Brest.  It remained a stronghold and thus belonged to the counts of L\u00e9on, whilst a town developed at the foot of the Roman enclosure.  In 537, count Elven held court at Brest.  His daughter, Azenor, is the subject of a legend and she has thus given her name to one of the castle's towers.\nAround 1064 or 1065, duke Conan II (or possibly L\u00e9on Morvan II, one of the vicomtes de L\u00e9on) ordered the renovation of the castle, cutting a moat around it and building a chapel within the enclosure, dedicated to \"Notre Dame de Piti\u00e9\" (destroyed in 1819), and a keep (perhaps in the northern corner of the fortifications).\nIn 1240, the castle passed to the duke of Brittany, John I, and became an essential part of the duchy's defence system.  Herv\u00e9 IV left the place, HQ of the counts of L\u00e9on, to avoid a confrontation and in return for 100 livres of rent.  The loss of the castle and attempts to retake it sounded the death knell of the county of L\u00e9on.\nThe castle remained unbeaten by the Normans.  During this period was built the tour C\u00e9sar, possibly on the ruins of a Gallo-Roman tower.  It blocked all access to the rocky outcrop.  The tour Azenor and the curtain wall onto which it is built also date to this time.\nThe dukes of Brittany\n\n\nThe 'burg' expanded and left the castle.  One of the two earliest burgs was situated beside Recouvrance (right bank) at the foot of what is now called the Tour Tanguy, and the other, larger and more enclosed one in front of the castle (left bank).\nIn return for services rendered, Philip IV of France made John II a peer, but John's death led to a 22-year war of succession in the dukedom.  In 1341, John, count of Montfort, half-brother of John III, fought Charles de Blois (husband of Jeanne de Penthi\u00e8vre) for the dukedom.  It was vital for John to capture Brest's castle, to prevent it becoming a refuge for his enemies or a landing-point for his enemies' ally Edward III of England.  To make certain his siege would be successful, he ensured he had a large numerical superiority and powerful siege engines to batter a breach in the walls, but even so the assault lasted several days.  The castle's captain Garnier de Clisson was killed in a counter-attack when he was trapped outside the walls by the closed portcullis, and so the defenders surrendered on the condition that their lives would be spared.  This was the last time the castle would be taken by force.  John of Montfort restored the buildings he had damaged in the siege and added to the defences, putting in place a garrison under Tanguy du Chastel, who built Brest's first enclosure.\nOn 7 September, the court of peers decided in favour of Charles de Blois's right to the duchy, and at the end of the year John of Montfort was imprisoned in the Louvre. His wife Jeanne of Flanders returned to the castle to shelter within its walls and sent an emissary to Edward III to seek an alliance.  Thus the English set up a base in the castle thanks to the political disorders of August 1342, giving them control of the maritime route used by their trading ships and military convoys from 1342 to 1397.  William of Rohan, earl of Northampton, headed the base with the title of lieutenant-general of Brittany, and Edward rejoined them in Brest 2 months later to support the rights of Montfort.\nThe Treaty of Gu\u00e9rande of 12 April 1365 concluded that women could only lay claim to the duchy of Brittany should there be no legitimate male heirs to the House of Brittany. John of Montfort rendered homage to Charles V of France and so Edward III no longer had any reason to continue his military presence at the castle.  However, the place was too important to give up and Montfort was still financially dependent on England.  Thus Charles V let Montfort off participating in the war he then launched on Edward III, but Montfort played a double game and passed a treaty on 21 February 1372 to open his lands to English troops even though Duguesclin and Clisson were marching from Brittany against him. Concarneau was captured.\nIn the spring the Breton lords seized the duchy's principal lands, denouncing their overlord, siding with the French king, rallying around the viscount of Rohan and charging constable Du Guesclin with hunting down the English. Montfort fled Brest for England on 28 April 1373 and the constable won victory after victory, retaking Concarneau and finally ending up before the walls of Brest castle in August.  Command of English forces in the east had been entrusted to Sir John Neville under the authority of lieutenant-general Robert Knowles, with Brest's garrison under the famous English captains Robert Kermoul\u00e9s and Fenville.  After three weeks of siege Du Guesclin concluded a 6-week truce to begin on 6 July.  At the end of that period, Kermoul\u00e9s promised to hand Brest castle over to the besiegers' if no other help reached its defenders by then and under the condition that the place could not be re-supplied.  The constable left the siege under the command of Olivier de Clisson to rejoin the duke of Anjou at the siege of the ch\u00e2teau de Derval. Clisson used the truce period to build the fort du Conquet.  On 2 August, the English fleet under Salisbury (who also took over command of the castle) disembarked supplies and reinforcements which definitively rendered the castle impregnable.\nThe Treaty of Bruges of 27 June 1375 marked an armistice between France and England, and officially handed Brest's castle over to John of Montfort, though the town remained under English protection and Montfort was forced to return to England that September.  In 1378 the Duke of Montfort was declared Duke of Brittany under the name John IV.  He pursued Jean de Blois, with Charles V of France taking his side.  John IV thus sought help from England and passed a new treaty, handing the castle over to Richard II of England.  The English disembarked reinforcements on 15 June and fought off an attack on the castle by French royal troops under the viscount of Rohan and including the lords of Laval, L\u00e9on,  Clisson and Beaumanoir.\n\nReturning to Brittany in 1379, John IV was welcomed by the Breton lords, who nevertheless criticized his pro-English stance.  The Duke of Brittany demanded in vain the return of his lands and, irritated by his English parent's bad faith, he besieged Brest in 1386.  Olivier De Clisson joined him on behalf of Charles VI of France.  Knowing a direct assault on the castle was impossible, they built two forts (one in stone and the other in wood) to blockade it, but these were attacked and destroyed by the English.  The attack was renewed the following year and, to prevent the castle being relieved by sea, a new wooden fort was built on boats placed in the middle of the goulet and at the entrance to the roadstead, raised on supporting stones on either bank.  However, the English captain Henry Percy ruined the wooden fort and captured the two others.\nThe peace-treaty drawn up between France and England by Charles VI and Richard II meant that finally, on 28 March 1397, the Duke of Brittany was given back his lands.  Jean Periou, lord of Mesgu\u00e9ant, became captain of Brest castle and Brittany's ships once again anchored below it.  John IV said \"he is not lord of Brittany who is not lord of Brest\", but only occupied the castle for 2 years, dying on 2 November 1399.\nThe town developed very slowly, whilst the castle's perimeter expanded toward the west.  The defended entrance was reinforced by a \"ch\u00e2telet\", probably consisting of a wooden walkway and towers.\nDucal castle\nThe war re-erupted in 1403.  John V was in his turn captured during the war between France and England.  It was this era which truly gave birth to the town and port of Brest, to the detriment of the castle.  The two banks were the objects of attack one after the other.  In 1405 the castle's old captain, the earl of Huntingdon, burned the fleet of the count of Marche which was anchored in the Penfeld.  John V marched on Brest at the head of 2,200 men, and he was joined by the Marshal of Rieux with 700 men at arms and Tanguy du Chatel with his peasants armed with pitchforks.  Exacerbated by the English exactions, Huntingdon and his troop made them carve a piece.  The Admiral of Brittany, John of Penhoat, left Roscoff and concluded the battle by destroying and capturing 40 ships and 2,000 men.  The English were repulsed once more in 1453 by the garrison of Jean de Quelennec, vicomte du Faou and Admiral of Brittany, though Crozon was pillaged and burned in reprisal.\n\nThe 15th century was one of great works to adapt to new weapons and developments in defensive works.  The castle's commanders (the comte de Languevez, 1405 - \u00c9on Phelips, 1407 - Tanguy de Kermorvan, 1424) restored the castle and made it proof against siege engines.  As in other fortified towns of the era, the duke built a fortified residence with the aim of making his stays in Brest more pleasant and more secure.  He thus added the tour Duchesse Anne, the tour Nord and the tour Azenor (which became a cellar), a kitchen, rooms, lodgings and a chapel.  The collection of towers was linked by curtain walls and formed a true \"closed-town\" lordly castle.\nDuchess Anne of Brittany\n\nCharles VIII concretely set his sights on the duchy of Brittany by the capture of Guingamp on 10 January 1489 by the viscount of Rohan and his troops.  Concerned for Brest, duchess Anne directed the lord of K\u00e9rousy to reinforce it, but the castle opened its gates to the viscount of Rohan (doubtless aided by the treason of the castle's captain).\nLike her predecessors, Anne initially allied herself with England.  She returned Concarnaeu and Brest to Henry VII of England and the new Anglo-Breton alliance led to 22 vessels blockading Brest by sea and a strong army with high-quality artillery besieging it by land.  However, the marshal of Rieux and admiral Bizien de K\u00e9rousy had to give way before the forces sent under Guillaume Carreau to defend Brest.  A French squadron under Graville and reinforced by the Malouins of Jean de Porcon, put an Anglo-Breton fleet to flight and re-supplied the besieged castle.  Harassed by the French, Rieux had no choice but to abandon it.\nAs a sign of his sovereignty, Charles VIII ordered that the French coat of arms be placed below the ravelin's gate.  Anne of Brittany's marriage to Charles VIII on 6 December 1491, then to Louis XII of France on 17 January 1499, definitively put the castle under French royal control.\nAnne of Brittany, Queen of France\nIn April 1505, the French king was gravely ill and Anne, his queen, decided to make a pilgrimage in the month of August to ask for his recovery.  Her procession left Blois for Brittany.  Her squire Gilles of Texue accompanied her, as did princes and lords of France and Breton barons and gentlemen.  Anne began on the Tro Breizh, a pious pilgrimage for Bretons around Brittany, visiting seven cathedrals dedicated to their founding saints and inspecting her domains and fortifications as she passed from town to town and castle to castle - Nantes, Vannes, Hennebont, Quimper, Locronan.  Jean d'Auton wrote in his chronicles of Louis XII that:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe was so honourably received that this was a marvellous triumphal procession, following the sea-coast, as far as Notre-Dame-du-Folgo\u00ebt, and is to be held a miraculous thing in that so great a multitude of men, women and little children came to see their lady and mistress by fields, roads and lanes.\u201d\n\nArriving at Le Folgo\u00ebt on 19 August, the end of her pilgrimage, Anne showed a desire to continue to Brest and contemplate the powerful castle that her father Francis II had embellished and modernised and the large nef Marie La Cordeli\u00e8re, one of the largest warships of the era.\nImportant works of fortification were begun at the castle throughout the 15th century.  The castle was adapted for the new weapon of the age - artillery.  To make its medieval curtain walls withstand metal cannonballs they were thickened by 5m and the tour Madeleine was built, then the tour Paradis, a logis-porte to defend the entrance.\n\nAt the end of August, the queen's imposing court arrived at the castle gates.  The bells of the castle's chapel to the Trinity rang to welcome her and she descended from her white-framed travelling-litter.  Escorted by several gentlemen, surrounded by ladies in waiting, and followed by valets and piqueurs,  she crossed the drawbridge of the first ditch surrounding the ravelin.  This triangular work commanding the main gate was at this era known as a moineau or cornichon.  Crowned with machicolis, this work covered casemates with loopholes.  Its ogivale gate was adorned with the French coat-of-arms surrounded by the cordon of Saint-Michel and surmounted by an open fleur-de-lys crown.  Passing through it, Anne doubtless saw this symbol, carved in Breton stone 16 years before as a reminder of the castle's submission to France.  Her procession finally entered the castle proper across the drawbridge of the Porte Royale.  This gate with an open door, closed by a \"herse\", has an ogivale opening.  This collection of buildings was covered by the Tours Paradis - two semicircular towers crowned with machicoulis and tiles.  In this era, the curtain walls on both sides of it were still flanked by their Gallo-Roman turrets.\nWithin the walls there was little new construction work, barring the chapel to the Trinity where pious queen Anne was received.  The city overall consisted of modest houses, having expanded up to the border of the castle enclosure.  (At the end of the 15th century it had 260 houses, making around 1300 inhabitants.)\nThe queen and her small court marked a path running along a ravine at the foot of which was a fountain and washhouses giving access to a postern which gave onto a forward work entitled \"Fer \u00e0 cheval\".  In this era there was no quay and so the rotonda was washed by the sea.  It was from this building that they could admire La Cordeli\u00e8re.  Back under sail, the carrack Amirale was resplendent under the castle walls.  The port had no military fleet.  Its position off the major trade routes meant that it was not a busy port, but the fortress continued to have major strategic significance, holding around 500 men and with the most important armament in the whole of Brittany (100 firearms, including nearly 50 cannons).\nWhen duchess Anne stayed at the castle, it was no longer only a fortress but also a modern and spacious ducal residence, hosting noble visitors in its keep.  It was in the keep that the dukes of Brittany stayed during their stays in Brest, reached by a third bridge across a ditch and entering via a low-architrave arched gate, showing a lion hold the shield of Brittany.  However, their large court was used to larger spaces.  The Tour du Midi (despite its great hall and oratory with Gothic windows), the lordly kitchens and the vast roads were not enough and so the queen did not remain long in Brest.\nThe league\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe populace is cruel, barbarous and bedevilled against the League, it is armed to the number of 15 or 20 thousand, and the town and castle of Brest are infinitely inconvenient, with monsieur de Chasteauneuf as their governor, making it the only place in lower Brittany held for the king. (Memoirs of Montmartin).\u201d\nRosampoul, son of J\u00e9r\u00f4me de Carn\u00e9, became the castle's captain on 12 June 1580 and rallied to the League, but he was little appreciated by the population and quickly had to give over the captaincy to Guy de Rieux, lord of Ch\u00e2teauneuf.  The king's lieutenant general was handed over thanks to these relations in the town, at the end of September 1589.  The faithful Guy de Rieux held Brest for the Protestant king Henry IV.  The situation at Brest was secure enough for the new governor to leave the following year for the siege of Hennebont.  His arms are now to be seen on the tour Duchesse Anne. The command of Brest next passed to his brother Ren\u00e9 de Rieux, lord of Sourd\u00e9ac, who also mounted vigorous anti-League operations.\nIn 1592, the royal seat of justice was transferred to Saint-Renan. In June, 5 to 6,000 League troops invested Recouvrance, to try to make the citadel fall.  Supported by the Spanish, they besieged the castle in vain for 5 months.  The garrison repulsed the assaults and cut the besiegers to pieces.  As a reward for the faithful services, on 31 December 1593 the inhabitants of Brest received the rights of bourgeoisie \"like the inhabitants of Bordeaux\".\nConvinced that a siege of Brest was doomed to fail, the League troops decided the following spring to blockade the roadstead and starve the castle into surrender.  They counted on help from their Spanish allies, who had been present in Brittany for two years.  Elisabeth came to the aid of Henry IV, deploying 2,400 men in the L\u00e9on.  Uncertain of Elisabeth's intentions, Sourd\u00e9ac refused to host an English garrison equal to that of the French and thereby to respect the terms of the treaty signed by the king as a collateral for loans from England.\n12 Spanish vessels disembarked their men and materials in spring 1594 at Camaret.  Colonel Don Juan del Aquila disembarked the men and materials needed to build an important fortification.  Built on what is now called pointe des Espagnols by Cristobal de Rojas and named \"Castilla de L\u00e9on\", it possessed a strategic position facing the English coasts.  It also aimed to make them master of Brest castle by blocking its access to the sea through the Goulet at its narrowest point.  Its guns' field of fire crossed with those of another battery built on the north bank of the Goulet and thus blocked all resupply of Brest by sea.  Headed by Jean, duke of Aumont, marshal of France and aided by the English ships and troops, the royal army besieged the fort from mid-October.  It was strongly defended by 400 Spanish farouches under captain Prax\u00e8de. Despite 3,000 Frenchmen, 2,000 Englishmen, 300 mounted arquebusiers and 400 gentlemen, it only finally fell on 18 November 1594.\nVauban's citadel\n\nIn 1631, wishing to give France a strong navy, cardinal Richelieu began works at Brest, which he had as a favour.  It was at this era that it became a true military port.\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Brest, the great military port, the thought of Richelieu, the hand of Louis XIV ; strong, arsenal and prison, cannons and warships, armies and  millions, the force of France piled up at France's mouth\u2026[2]\u201d\nHowever, it was Colbert, effectively Minister for the Navy, who gave Brest a real boost to its growth by his development of its arsenal from 1669 onwards.  The intendant Pierre Chertemps de Seuil was responsible for the initial construction projects on the arsenal between 1670 and 1680.  Reinforced and modernised, the castle still defended the premier port of the royal fleet.  In 1680, a new battery completed the castle to the south-west to guarantee the defence of the harbour entrance.  To the north-east an imposing bastioned fort \"\u00e0 la Vauban\" protected the harbour approaches.  The town's population thus began to expand substantially, especially when it was merged with Recouvrance in 1681.  Pierre Massiac de Sainte-Colombe's project for modernising the defences of the town, arsenal and their surroundings was initiated that year and taken over and transformed by Vauban in May 1683 to 1695.  He destroyed the last Roman towers and the pepper-pot roofs of the keep.  In this era the defences protected the castle effectively against attack from the sea, but the fortress had to defend above all against a landborne attack should an English fleet succeed in disembarking troops on the coast.  The castle became a citadel, overlooking the town, the countryside and their surroundings all at once.\n\nA glacis, a covered road and half-moons prolonged the fortifications on the landward side.  The parapets were redesigned and given plunging embrasures.  To form a vast artillery platform, the tour Duchesse Anne and the tour Nord were linked by a new work.  Only the tours Paradis retained the medieval appearance.  The curtain walls were widened, and a fausse-braie built to reinforce the wall between tour Madeleine and the tours Paradis against artillery fire.  Batteries at the mouth of the goulet, at Camaret and Bertheaume, were also built.  The interventions of Vauban were the last major stage in the castle's evolution.\nStatue of Louis XVI\n\nIn 1785, Louis XVI launched a major construction project at the castle to mark his recognition of the town.  Leadership of this project of was put under the direction of M. Jallier de Savault. Notably he oversaw the erection at the town's highest point of a monumental statue of Louis.  It would have to be built on the site of the tour C\u00e9sar.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cso that no ship, small or large, could enter the roadstead, no movement made in the port, no salute be given or returned, without the King in some way seeing them and presiding over them. - M. Jallier de Savault\u201d\nThe project was made up of, at the end of the rue du ch\u00e2teau, an oval \"place d'armes\", planted in trees.  From this place to the extremity of the Parc-au-Duc, the rue Royale, a wide street allowed it to face the roadstead.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cwith some emotion, the public would see a monument to Louis XVI handing privileges to Brittany and the liberty of the seas, raised on the ruins of a building dedicated to this Caesar who enchained the whole world and submitted it to the Romans. - M. Jallier de Savault\u201d\n\nThis project would, without qualms, have erased 14 centuries of history, but in April 1788 the Comte d'Hector, commander of the French Navy, declared that the project was incompatible with the naval works he envisaged on the Parc-au-Duc site[3]  Events, in any case, would have prevented the plan being carried out.\nSecond World War - the final siege\nBrest fell into German hands on 19 June 1940 and the citadel was occupied by their troops, with the tours Paradis once again serving as a prison (this time for those condemned to deportation).  From a terre-plein reclaimed from the sea in 1931, the Germans built underground works into the cliff from which the castle could be accessed.\nAfter the Germans' retreat following D-Day, \"Fortress Brest\" became one of the pockets of German resistance.  It was commanded by general Ramcke, of the 2nd Parachutist Division.  In August 1944, Allied troops arrived in front of Brest's ramparts.  The civil population was invited to evacuate on 7 August.  The place du Ch\u00e2teau was particularly affected by the bombardments of the 14th of August in preparation for an assault.  On 25th general Ramcke issued the order \"I count on every parachutist doing his duty to the utmost with a fanatical zeal.  The 1st Division was immortalised at Monte Cassino.  The 2nd will be immortalised at Brest.\"\nThe castle was the subject of bombardment again from the afternoon of 2 September, with the pont National being destroyed the following day.  The drama of the explosion at the abri Sadi-Carnot occurred on the night of 8\/9 September.  The siege of the town lasted 43 days and it finally fell to the Allied force under general Middleton on 18 September.  After having refused to surrender, general Ramcke left for Crozon with a handful of fanatics, but ended up giving himself up on 23 September.  Although it bore scars from the fighting, the castle remained firmly established on its bedrock, though the barracks built by the Nazis had been razed and would not be rebuilt.\nToday\nThe last buildings were ceded to the French Navy in 1945 and restoration of the whole castle began, for it to house the Maritime Prefecture for the Second Region and the commander-in-chief for the Atlantic.  The seat of the maritime commander had until then been in h\u00f4tel Saint-Pierre, since 23 September 1797.  A new central building was built to designs by the architects Niermans and Gutb, and completed and occupied in 1953.  Its great gallery leading to the Directors' Council Room houses the portrait of the prefect's 150 predecessors since 1636.\nThe maritime prefect's residence replaced the signal station on Parc au Duc, which had itself been replaced by a watchtower built at the top of the tour C\u00e9sar.  The underground works built by the Germans house the naval command centre for the Atlantic and for the Force oc\u00e9anique strat\u00e9gique.\nArchitecture\n\n13th century- The tour C\u00e9sar\nDating to the 3rd century, the tour C\u00e9sar was built on the possible remains of a Gallo-Roman tower, and this is one of the possible origins of its name.  It has served as an office, lodgings, prison, magazine and finally supporting the signal station controlling movements in the port.\nIt stands in front of the south-west facade, to which it is attached by two curtain walls forming a redoubt.  A postern with a drawbridge allows the tower to be accessed from outside the castle.  Although sealed off, this postern is visible from the garden of the prefect's residence.\nKeep\n\nLocated in the north-east angle of the enclosure, the keep is actually the former citadel of the medieval closed-town and the heart of the medieval defensive system, forming a small castle on its own isolated from the rest of the site.  In origin it was made up of three main towers linked by curtain walls - to the south, the tour Duchesse Anne, to the north the tour du Donjon, to the west the tour Az\u00e9nor.  The main entrance was from the west, formed of a crenelated gate and a drawbridge across the moat separating the citadel from the rest of the castle-town.  This collection of works formed a polygonal courtyard, at 2.2m below present ground level, housing a well, oubliettes and several underground rooms.\nFlanked by the bastion de Sourd\u00e9ac, with one tower of the keep reinforced, the keep was completed by Vauban from 1683 onwards.  One wall and vaulted rooms linked the tour du Midi and the tour du Donjon, and the keep's pepper-pot roofs vanished in favour of vast platforms for powerful artillery pieces.  Finally, in the 19th century, the keep was pierced by bays.  The first floor now houses the main rooms of the port archive, and the upper floor houses an oratory and the library of the French Navy.\nThe tour Azenor (13th century)\n\nThe present tower was built in the 13th century on the ruins of the previous one.  Its two lower levels are accessible from the courtyard via a staircase built into the thickness of the wall.  They serve as stores and magazines.  The two upper levels, reserved for habitation, are cut off from the roads and reached from a wall-walk.  Inside these floors are octagonal rooms, whose plans do not exactly superimpose one floor on the other.  They have been little modified apart from Vauban's alteration to the roof.  It was abandoned in the 19th century and the only access is from the courtyards, the main entrance having been neglected.\nIts name originates in the legend of Princess Azenor reported to us by the Dominican Albert Le Grand in his \"Lives of the Saints\".  It is a common hagiographic plot, also adapted in Chaucer's The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale in his The Canterbury Tales.\n\n\n\n\n\u201c...Azenor was rich in form, right for a [martyr's] palm, beautiful like a star, and this external beauty was nothing in comparison with her love.\u201d\nEven, lord of Brest, had only one child, named Azenor.  Around 537, she married the Count of Go\u00eblo.  The young married couple set themselves up in a castle built by King Audren (Chatelaudren).  Widowed, Even remarried, and Azenor's stepmother never ceased to embarrass her stepdaughter.  Jealous, she swore to get rid of Azenor.  She accused her of adultery with the aid of false witnesses.  The count of Go\u00eblo believed this calumny and the princess was shut up in the castle's darkest tower.  Condemned to death, she escaped the stake when it was learned she was pregnant.  The judges, probably bought for gold, condemned her to be placed in a barrel and set adrift at sea.  The barrel floated for 5 months.  Each day, an angel visited the daughter of the prince of L\u00e9on to bring her all she needed.  After a perilous voyage, Azenor landed on the bank of the Beauport in Ireland, where she gave birth to a son.  She named him Budoc, or 'saved from the waters', and he became a great saint.  Her stepmother's death, during her exile, avowing the truth to Azenor's husband.  He decided to set out to look for her to pardon her and take her back as his wife, but he died on their return after having searched long for her, followed shortly afterwards by his wife.  Even welcomed his grandson to his court and raised him to the nobility.\nThe tour de la Duchesse Anne (or tour du midi) (14th century)\nThis tower initially formed the castle's tour du logis during the Middle Ages.  Its defensive side was turned towards the inside of the enclosure and on each of its four levels it had one rectangular and one hexagonal room.  Its construction and its modifications gave it an increasingly perfect autonomy.  It housed a kitchen, apartments, cellars pierced by firing-embrasures, an internal gallery and lighting bays.  It contained an oratory within the governor's apartments.\nThe armouries of Guy de Rieux (1589)\n\nIn 1589, the castle's governor embraced the Catholic League, but Guy de Rieux, captain of the royal army, made him hand Brest over, thus becoming the only Breton city to back Henry IV.  De Rieux's arms were carved in the castle's stones (1589).  He died at sea returning from the siege of Hennebont in Morbihan in December 1590, and was succeeded by his brother.  After the Second World War these arms were found in rubble near the keep and embedded in the wall of the keep in restoration work during the 1950s.\nThe bastion Sourd\u00e9ac (16th century)\nSeveral attempted English landings in the mid-16th century on this site solidified the threat of attack against the castle and encouraged the French to build a stronger fortification there.  The work of an Italian engineer, Pietro Fr\u00e9dance, this trapezoid-plan bastion envelops the keep on its northern side and protects it from landborne attack.  The first stone of it was laid in December 1560 and its construction took 37 years.\nIt is made up of a vast artillery platform and a set of underground casemates whose wide embrasures cover the entrance to the port.  It is reached by a wide staircase opening into the keep's courtyard.  A small staircase serves a guichet (now obstructed) at the foot of the bastion, at the outside of these casemates.  A counter-mine gallery bypasses the foundations of tour du donjon at 15m underground, below the terre-plein.  Off it leads a second series of casemates, covering the main gate and the north courtyard of the fa\u00e7ade.  These are now buried under a parking embankment.  The collection of works is topped off by \u00e9chauguettes placed at its corners, such as figureheads.\nThe tour du donjon (16th century)\nBuilt in 1597 by Sourd\u00e9ac, on the site of a ruined (probably Gallo-Roman) tower.\nThe barracks in 1894\n\nA - Paradis Barracks\nB - Site Offices and Intendent's Offices, former civil prison (1822\u20131859)\nC - Esplanade Barracks, serving the infirmary, backed by the south curtain wall (some remains)\nD - Plougastel Barracks, built 1591 - 1624 by Sourd\u00e9ac (classed as a historic monument in 1923)\nE - Monsieur Barracks, serving the armoury (1822\u20131825)\nF - C\u00e9sar Barracks (completed in 1766)\nG - Armoury, on the site of the lodgings for the site's major and for the king's lieutenant\nH - Artillery magazines, built in 1777 and 1624 by Sourd\u00e9ac (classed as a historic monument in 1923)\nThe Triumph of Amphitrite\n\nBecoming a historic monument in its own right, the base of the \"Triomphe d'Amphitrite\" is in the courtyard of the Pr\u00e9fecture Maritime.  This pedestal, with a statue and fountain inaugurated in 1803, is adorned with three tritons fixed to a column pouring out water into three basins.  It is the work of the engineer Tarb\u00e9 de Vauxclairs.\nThe  of Amphitrite by Antoine Coysevox, taken from the jardins de Marly where they formed part of the 1706 cascade de Marly[4] by the Consulate, was set up by the Pr\u00e9fet maritime Caffarelli near the building now known as porte Tourville.  Prefect Chaucheprat had it transplanted from the square (then being redesigned) to the gardens of the home of the Pr\u00e9fecture Maritime from 1800 to 1944, the former h\u00f4tel Saint-Pierre on the south side of the rue de Siam in the town centre.  In 1940 Brest artistic and historical treasures were kept in safety in the ch\u00e2teau de Kerjean, and on the liberation the pedestal was dimsantled and reerected in the castle and the statue moved to the mus\u00e9e du Louvre.[5]\nMus\u00e9e national de la Marine\nSince 1955, the castle has also housed collections from the Mus\u00e9e national de la Marine. This makes it a kind of heir to the ship models room installed on the first floor of the sculpture workshop in the Brest arsenal in 1826. The collections evacuated during the Second World War were transferred into the tours Paradis in 1958. In 2018, the Napoleonic imperial barge of 1810 was removed from display in the Paris museum to be restored for return to Brest and display here. An extension to the museum in the keep was completed in 1985.\nIt displays famous sculptures by Yves Collet (Mars, Amphitrite, Minerve and Neptune, guarding the road), ship models, sculptures paintings and other objects related to the development of the prison, the military port, the naval constructions and maritime life of Brest.\nSee also\nPonant fleet\n\n\nBibliography\n\n(in French) La monographie du ch\u00e2teau de Brest (origines - Description - Documents), de M.

As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place is defined as a place that has a self-governing local government and as such has been \"incorporated\" by the state it is in. Each state has different laws defining how a place can be incorporated and so an \"incorporated place\" as recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau can designate a variety of places, such as a city, town, village, borough, and township.[lower-alpha 1]\nThe other type of place defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes are census-designated places. Census-designated places are distinct from incorporated places because they do not have a local government and thus depend on higher government bodies, such as a county, for governance. Census-designated places are defined as being in an unincorporated area. Census-designated places that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile are listed in a separate table below. The five boroughs of New York City, and the census-designated places of Puerto Rico that have densities over 10,000, are also listed in separate tables below.\nIncorporated places with a density of over 10,000 people per square mile\nThe following data about the most densely populated incorporated places in the United States is from the U.S. Census Bureau and is from the 2010 U.S. Census,[3][4] except for the tables on Puerto Rico, which show data from the 2000 US Census. The following ranking is made up of incorporated places of any population, but also of interest may be lists compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau of all places with at least 50,000 population, arranged alphabetically by state,[5] and ranked by total population;[6] the population density for each place is also given in the lists.\nThe population density is calculated by dividing the population by the land area so that it represents the number of people living in one square mile of land area. The population densities listed in the table below do not work out to be exactly the result of dividing the listed population by the listed land area because the land areas have been rounded off to two decimal places, but the population densities were calculated before rounding the land area figures. The land area figures are calculated using the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER system. The U.S. Census Bureau has released the exact land area figures for all places in the U.S. in square meters and square miles;[7] the exact land areas are the figures used for calculating the population densities seen in the table below.\nThe list below only includes incorporated places of the fifty states. Unincorporated census-designated places, places in Puerto Rico, and the five boroughs of New York City are all listed in separate tables below. The District of Columbia would be included in the list, but Washington, D.C. misses the 10,000 mark as it has a population density of 9,800 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census (as of 2013 American Community Survey estimates, however, Washington now has a density of 10,528 people per square mile).[8]\nThose cities not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area in bold.\n\nCensus-designated places\nThe following is a list of unincorporated census-designated places with population densities of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2010 U.S. Census.[3][4] The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if it was included in the above table of incorporated places.\n\nNew York City boroughs\nThe following lists the population densities of the five boroughs of New York City as of the 2010 U.S. Census.[9] The rank column indicates the rank they would have if included in the above table of incorporated places. Staten Island has a population density below 10,000 but it is included for comparative purposes.\n\nPuerto Rico\nThe following lists the census-designated places in Puerto Rico that have a population density of over 10,000 people per square mile as of the 2000 U.S. Census.[10] The census-designated places in Puerto Rico include zonas urbanas (urban areas) and comunidades (communities). The municipality, or municipio, the place is located in is also included in the table below. The municipalities are what is thought of as \"incorporated places\" in Puerto Rico because there are no subordinate governments within them, only eight electoral districts which hold no administrative functions (the electoral districts are what generally constitute the census-designated places in this list below). No municipalities have a density over 10,000 as of the 2000 U.S. Census; the San Juan Municipio is the densest at 9,084.4 people per square mile.[11] The Jayuya municipality is not part of any metropolitan area as it is only part of the Jayuya micropolitan area (see Puerto Rico census statistical areas). The rank column indicates the rank the place would have if included in the above table of incorporated places.\n\nList of incorporated cities in the United States with over 75,000 residents\nBelow is a list of the most densely populated cities in the United States which have a population density over 10,000 people per square mile and have a total population of over 75,000 according to the 2010 Census. This list relates to the first list, but excludes cities under 75,000. \nThose cities not a part of a larger city's metropolitan area in bold.\n\nDistributions\nThe following distributions only include the 125 incorporated places with population densities over 10,000 people per square mile. They do not include the 36 census-designated places, the boroughs of New York City, or the 11 places in Puerto Rico with densities over 10,000.\nMetropolitan areas\nThe following ranks United States metropolitan areas by the number of incorporated places with densities over 10,000 within them. If two or more metropolitan areas have the same number of incorporated places, as is the case of the eight metros with one place, the metro areas are ranked by the densest incorporated place within the metro area.\n\nStates\nThe following ranks U.S. states by the number of incorporated places with densities over 10,000 within them. The \"10,000+ places\" column only includes incorporated places, it does not include census-designated places (CDPs). If two or more states have the same number of places, as is the case of the 36 states that contain no incorporated places with a density over 10,000, the states are ranked by the densest incorporated place within the state. The density figures for the densest incorporated place within each state are from the 2010 United States Census, and all the data for this ranking is from the U.S. Census Bureau.[3][4]\nHawaii officially does not contain any incorporated places, as the city of Honolulu is coextensive with Honolulu County, which makes up the whole island of Oahu. When the U.S. Census Bureau ranks incorporated places by population, it usually includes the Honolulu census-designated place, which is the urban center of Honolulu, in its ranking of incorporated places.[12] Therefore, for this list of the densest incorporated places by state, the Honolulu CDP is considered the densest incorporated place in Hawaii. The District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are also included in this list, but are unranked so that the ranking includes only the 50 states. Puerto Rico also officially does not contain any incorporated places, as the lowest form of local government in Puerto Rico are the municipios, which are equivalent to counties. For this ranking, the municipios are counted as the incorporated places in Puerto Rico, and the San Juan Municipio is the densest.\n\nPopulations\n\n\n\nNew York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia are the only incorporated places in the United States that have a population over 1,000,000 and a population density over 10,000 people per square mile.\n\nLand areas\n\nPopulation densities\n\n\nSee also\n\nUnited States of America\nOutline of the United States\nIndex of United States-related articles\n\nBook:United States\nUnited States Census Bureau\nDemographics of the United States\nList of US states and territories by population\nList of US cities by population\nLists of US cities and metropolitan areas\nUnited States Office of Management and Budget\nUnited States statistical area\nThe 1067USstatisticalareas comprise 366MSAs, 576\u03bcSAs, and 125CSAs\nUnited States primary statistical area\nList of the 718USPSAs\nUnited States combined statistical area\nList of the 125USCSAs\nUnited States core based statistical area\nList of the 942USCBSAs\nUnited States metropolitan statistical area\nList of the 366USMSAs\nList of the 366USMSAs by GDP\nUnited States micropolitan statistical area\nList of the 576US\u03bcSAs\nList of United States urban areas \u2013 lists contiguous urban areas without regard to municipal boundaries, includes the population density of each urban area\nCounty statistics of the United States \u2013 includes a list of the 50 most densely populated counties\nList of U.S. states by population density\nWorldwide\nList of cities by population density\nList of countries and dependencies by population density\nList of the most densely populated country subdivisions\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n \u2013 from the U.S. Census Bureau, various tables and maps from the 2000 U.S. Census and 1990 U.S. Census of population density statistics\n \u2013 from Demographia, ranks the population density for all incorporated places over 50,000 population from the 2000 U.S. Census.

{"question":"What do Grasshoppers eat?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[999],"passage_indices":[2],"start_positions":[792],"yes_no_answer":["NONE"]},"context":["\n\n\n\nGrasshoppers are a group of insects belonging to the suborder Caelifera. They are among what is probably the most ancient living group of chewing herbivorous insects, dating back to the early Triassic around 250 million years ago. \nGrasshoppers are typically ground-dwelling insects with powerful hind legs which allow them to escape from threats by leaping vigorously. As hemimetabolous insects, they do not undergo complete metamorphosis; they hatch from an egg into a nymph or \"hopper\" which undergoes five moults, becoming more similar to the adult insect at each developmental stage. At high population densities and under certain environmental conditions, some grasshopper species can change color and behavior and form swarms. Under these circumstances, they are known as locusts.\nGrasshoppers are plant-eaters, with a few species at times becoming serious pests of cereals, vegetables and pasture, especially when they swarm in their millions as locusts and destroy crops over wide areas. They protect themselves from predators by camouflage; when detected, many species attempt to startle the predator with a brilliantly-coloured wing-flash while jumping and (if adult) launching themselves into the air, usually flying for only a short distance. Other species such as the rainbow grasshopper have warning coloration which deters predators. Grasshoppers are affected by parasites and various diseases, and many predatory creatures feed on both nymphs and adults. The eggs are the subject of attack by parasitoids and predators.\nGrasshoppers have had a long relationship with humans. Swarms of locusts can have devastating effects and cause famine, and even in smaller numbers, the insects can be serious pests. They are used as food in countries such as Mexico and Indonesia. They feature in art, symbolism and literature.\nPhylogeny\nGrasshoppers belong to the suborder Caelifera. Although, \"grasshopper\" is sometimes used as a common name for the suborder in general,[1][2][3] some sources restrict it to the more \"advanced\" groups.[4] They may be placed in the infraorder Acrididea[5] and have been referred-to as \"short-horned grasshoppers\" in older texts[6] to distinguish them from the also-obsolete term \"long-horned grasshoppers\" (now bush-crickets or katydids) with their much longer antennae.  The phylogeny of the Caelifera, based on mitochondrial ribosomal RNA of thirty-two taxa in six out of seven superfamilies, is shown as a cladogram. The Ensifera (crickets, etc.) Caelifera and all the superfamilies of grasshoppers except Pamphagoidea appear to be monophyletic.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthoptera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsifera(crickets)\n[6 superfamilies] Caelifera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTridactyloidea \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTetrigoidea \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEumastacidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProscopiidae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPneumoridae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPyrgomorphidae \nAcrididae + Pamphagidae \n\nIn evolutionary terms, the split between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary;[9] the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups are found in the early Jurassic.[10][11] Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.[12]\nThe Caelifera includes some 2,400 valid genera and about 11,000 known species. Many undescribed species probably exist, especially in tropical wet forests. The Caelifera have a predominantly tropical distribution with fewer species known from temperate zones, but most of the superfamilies have representatives worldwide. They are almost exclusively herbivorous and are probably the oldest living group of chewing herbivorous insects.[12]\nThe most diverse superfamily is the Acridoidea, with around 8,000 species. The two main families in this are the Acrididae (grasshoppers and locusts) with a worldwide distribution, and the Romaleidae (lubber grasshoppers), found chiefly in the New World. The Ommexechidae and Tristiridae are South American, and the Lentulidae, Lithidiidae and Pamphagidae are mainly African. The Pauliniids are nocturnal and can swim or skate on water, and the Lentulids are wingless.[10] Pneumoridae are native to Africa, particularly southern Africa, and are distinguished by the inflated abdomens of the males.[13]\nCharacteristics\nGrasshoppers have the typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held vertically at an angle to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, and a pair of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.[14]\nThe thorax and abdomen are segmented and have a rigid cuticle made up of overlapping plates composed of chitin. The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as tegmina, are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for gripping. The hind leg is particularly powerful; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear stridulatory pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines and there are a pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.[14]\n\nThe abdomen has eleven segments, the first of which is fused to the thorax and contains the tympanal organ and hearing system. Segments two to eight are ring-shaped and joined by flexible membranes. Segments nine to eleven are reduced in size; segment nine bears a pair of cerci and segments ten and eleven house the reproductive organs. Female grasshoppers are normally larger than males, with short ovipositors.[14] The name of the suborder \"Caelifera\" comes from the Latin and  means chisel-bearing, referring to the shape of the ovipositor.[15]\nThose species that make easily heard noises usually do so by rubbing a row of pegs on the hind legs against the edges of the forewings (stridulation). These sounds are produced mainly by males to attract females, though in some species the females also stridulate.[16]\nGrasshoppers may be confused with crickets, but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae and the structure of the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced.[17] Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20\u201324 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.[16]\nBiology\nDiet and digestion\n\n\nMost grasshoppers are polyphagous, eating vegetation from multiple plant sources,[18] but some are omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops.[19] The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.[20]\nSensory organs\n\nGrasshoppers have a typical insect nervous system, and have an extensive set of external sense organs. On the side of the head are a pair of large compound eyes which give a broad field of vision and can detect movement, shape, colour and distance. There are also three simple eyes (ocelli) on the forehead which can detect light intensity, a pair of antennae containing olfactory (smell) and touch receptors, and mouthparts containing gustatory (taste) receptors.[21] At the front end of the abdomen there is a pair of tympanal organs for sound reception. There are numerous fine hairs (setae) covering the whole body that act as mechanoreceptors (touch and wind sensors), and these are most dense on the antennae, the palps (part of the mouth), and on the cerci at the tip of the abdomen.[22] There are special receptors (campaniform sensillae) embedded in the cuticle of the legs that sense pressure and cuticle distortion.[23] There are internal \"chordotonal\" sense organs specialized to detect position and movement about the joints of the exoskeleton. The receptors convey information to the central nervous system through sensory neurons, and most of these have their cell bodies located in the periphery near the receptor site itself.[22]\nCirculation and respiration\n\nLike other insects, grasshoppers have an open circulatory system and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in the upper part of the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange.[24] Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.[25]\nJumping\nA large grasshopper, such as a locust, can jump about a metre (twenty body lengths) without using its wings; the acceleration peaks at about 20g.[26] Grasshoppers jump by extending their large back legs and pushing against the substrate (the ground, a twig, a blade of grass or whatever else they are standing on); the reaction force propels them into the air.[27] They jump for several reasons; to escape from a predator, to launch themselves into flight, or simply to move from place to place. For the escape jump in particular there is strong selective pressure to maximize take-off velocity, since this determines the range. This means that the legs must thrust against the ground with both high force and a high velocity of movement.  A fundamental property of muscle is that it cannot contract with high force and high velocity at the same time. Grasshoppers overcome this by using a catapult mechanism to amplify the mechanical power produced by their muscles.[28]\nThe jump is a three-stage process.[29] First, the grasshopper fully flexes the lower part of the leg (tibia) against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle (the back legs of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position). Second, there is a period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, pennate extensor tibiae muscle, but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle, but the latter is aided by specialisations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed.[30]  Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg.[31] The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high force (up to 14N in the desert locust), but because it is slow only low power is needed. The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.[32][33]\nStridulation\n\nMale grasshoppers spend much of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified in the presence of a rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby.[34] In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.[13]\nLife cycle\n\n\nIn most grasshopper species, conflicts between males over females rarely escalate beyond ritualistic displays. Some exceptions include the chameleon grasshopper (Kosciuscola tristis), where males may fight on top of ovipositing females; engaging in leg grappling, biting, kicking and mounting.[35]\nThe newly emerged female grasshopper has a preoviposition period of a week or two while she increases in weight and her eggs mature. After mating, the female of most species digs a hole with her ovipositor and lays a batch of eggs in a pod in the ground near food plants, generally in the summer. After laying the eggs, she covers the hole with soil and litter.[14] Some, like the semi-aquatic Cornops aquaticum, deposit the pod directly into plant tissue.[36] The eggs in the pod are glued together with a froth in some species.  After a few weeks of development, the eggs of most species in temperate climates go into diapause, and pass the winter in this state. Diapause is broken by a sufficiently low ground temperature, with development resuming as soon as the ground warms above a certain threshold temperature. The embryos in a pod generally all hatch out within a few minutes of each other. They soon shed their membranes and their exoskeletons harden. These first instar nymphs can then jump away from predators.[37]\n\nGrasshoppers undergo incomplete metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult, each instar becoming larger and more like an adult, with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, spends about 25 to 30 days as a nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as an adult.[37]\nSwarming\n\n\nLocusts are the swarming phase of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae. Swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin.[38] This causes the grasshopper to change colour, feed more and breed faster. The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.[39]\nFollowing this transformation, under suitable conditions dense nomadic bands of flightless nymphs known as \"hoppers\" can occur, producing pheromones which attract the insects to each other. With several generations in a year, the locust population can build up from localised groups into vast accumulations of flying insects known as plagues, devouring all the vegetation they encounter. The largest recorded locust swarm was one formed by the now-extinct Rocky Mountain locust in 1875; the swarm was 1,800 miles (2,900km) long and 110 miles (180km) wide,[40] and one estimate puts the number of locusts involved at 3.5 trillion.[41]\nAn adult desert locust can eat about 2g (0.1oz) of plant material each day, so the billions of insects in a large swarm can be very destructive, stripping all the foliage from plants in an affected area and consuming stems, flowers, fruits, seeds and bark.[42]\nPredators, parasites and pathogens\n\nGrasshoppers have a wide range of predators at different stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by bee-flies, ground beetles and blister beetles; hoppers and adults are taken by other insects such as ants, robber flies and sphecid wasps, by spiders, and by many birds and small mammals including dogs and cats.[43]\nThe eggs and nymphs are under attack by parasitoids including blow flies, flesh flies, and tachinid flies. External parasites of adults and nymphs include mites.[43] Female grasshoppers parasitised by mites produce fewer eggs and thus have fewer offspring than unaffected individuals.[44]\n\nThe grasshopper nematode (Mermis nigrescens) is a long slender worm that infects grasshoppers, living in the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten.[45] Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite to continue with the next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.[46][47]\n\nGrasshoppers are affected by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. This widespread fungus has been used to control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the infection is not usually lethal because basking in the sun has the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus.[49] The fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to climb to the top of a plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.[50]\nThe fungal pathogen Metarhizium acridum is found in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused epizootics in grasshoppers. It is being investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control.[49] The microsporidian fungus Nosema locustae, once considered to be a protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.[49]\nAnti-predator defences\n\nGrasshoppers exemplify a range of anti-predator adaptations, enabling them to avoid detection, to escape if detected, and in some cases to avoid being eaten if captured. Grasshoppers are often camouflaged to avoid detection by predators that hunt by sight; some species can change their coloration to suit their surroundings.[51]\nSeveral species such as the hooded leaf grasshopper Phyllochoreia ramakrishnai (Eumastacoidea)  are detailed mimics of leaves. Stick grasshoppers (Proscopiidae) mimic wooden sticks in form and coloration.[52] Grasshoppers often have deimatic patterns on their wings, giving a sudden flash of bright colours that may startle predators long enough to give time to escape in a combination of jump and flight.[53]\nSome species are genuinely aposematic, having both bright warning coloration and sufficient toxicity to dissuade predators. Dictyophorus productus (Pyrgomorphidae) is a \"heavy, bloated, sluggish insect\" that makes no attempt to hide; it has a bright red abdomen. A Cercopithecus monkey that ate other grasshoppers refused to eat the species.[54] Another species, the rainbow or painted grasshopper of Arizona, Dactylotum bicolor (Acridoidea), has been shown by experiment with a natural predator, the little striped whiptail lizard, to be aposematic.[55]\n\nGaudy grasshopper, Atractomorpha lata, evades predators with camouflage.\nLubber grasshopper, Titanacris albipes, has deimatically coloured wings, used to startle predators.\nLeaf grasshopper, Phyllochoreia ramakrishnai, mimics a green leaf.\nPainted grasshopper, Dactylotum bicolor, deters predators with warning coloration.\nSpotted grasshopper, Aularches miliaris, defends itself with toxic foam and warning colours.[56]\n\nRelationship with humans\n\n\n\nIn art and media\nGrasshoppers are occasionally depicted in artworks, such as the Dutch Golden Age painter Balthasar van der Ast's still life oil painting, Flowers in a Vase with Shells and Insects, c. 1630, now in the National Gallery, London, though the insect may be a bush-cricket.[57]\nAnother orthopteran is found in Rachel Ruysch's still life Flowers in a Vase, c. 1685. The seemingly static scene is animated by a \"grasshopper on the table that looks about ready to spring\", according to the gallery curator Betsy Wieseman, with other invertebrates including a spider, an ant, and two caterpillars.[58][59]\nGrasshoppers are also featured in cinema. The 1957 film Beginning of the End portrayed giant grasshoppers attacking Chicago.[60] In the 1998 Pixar film A Bug's Life, the heroes are the members of an ant colony, and the lead villain and his henchmen are grasshoppers.[61]\nSymbolism\n\nGrasshoppers are sometimes used as symbols.[62] During the Greek Archaic Era, the grasshopper was the symbol of the polis of Athens,[63] possibly because they were among the most common insects on the dry plains of Attica.[63] Native Athenians for a while wore golden grasshopper brooches to symbolise that they were of pure Athenian lineage with no foreign ancestors.[63] Another symbolic use of the grasshopper is Sir Thomas Gresham's gilded grasshopper in Lombard Street, London, dating from 1563;[lower-alpha 1] the building was for a while the headquarters of the Guardian Royal Exchange, but the company declined to use the symbol for fear of confusion with the locust.[64]\nWhen grasshoppers appear in dreams, these have been interpreted as symbols of \"Freedom, independence, spiritual enlightenment, inability to settle down or commit to decision\". Locusts are taken literally to mean devastation of crops in the case of farmers; figuratively as \"wicked men and women\" for non-farmers; and \"Extravagance, misfortune, & ephemeral happiness\" by \"gypsies\".[65]\nAs food\n\n\nIn some countries, grasshoppers are used as food.[66] In southern Mexico, grasshoppers, known as chapulines, are eaten in a variety of dishes, such as in tortillas with chilli sauce.[67] Grasshoppers are served on skewers in some Chinese food markets, like the Donghuamen Night Market.[68] Fried grasshoppers (walang goreng) are eaten in the Gunung Kidul Regency, Yogyakarta, Java in Indonesia.[69] In America, the Ohlone burned grassland to herd grasshoppers into pits where they could be collected as food.[70]\n\nIt is recorded in the Bible that John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey (Greek: \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2  \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76  \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9  \u1f04\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, akr\u00eddes ka\u00ec m\u00e9li \u00e1grion) while living in the wilderness;[71] attempts have been made to explain the locusts as suitably ascetic vegetarian food such as carob beans, but the plain meaning of \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 is the insects.[72][73]\nAs pests\n\nGrasshoppers eat large quantities of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a major population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so that large numbers of nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.[74]\nGrasshoppers can best be prevented from becoming pests by manipulating their environment. Shade provided by trees will discourage them and they may be prevented from moving onto developing crops by removing coarse vegetation from fallow land and field margins and discouraging thick growth beside ditches and on roadside verges. With increasing numbers of grasshoppers, predator numbers may increase, but this seldom happens rapidly enough to have much effect on populations. Biological control is being investigated, and spores of the protozoan parasite Nosema locustae can be used mixed with bait to control grasshoppers, being more effective with immature insects.[75]  On a small scale, neem products can be effective as a feeding deterrent and as a disruptor of nymphal development. Insecticides can be used, but adult grasshoppers are difficult to kill, and as they move into fields from surrounding rank growth, crops may soon become reinfested.[74]\nSome grasshopper species, like the Chinese rice grasshopper, are a pest in rice paddies. Ploughing exposes the eggs on the surface of the field, to be destroyed by sunshine or eaten by natural enemies. Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place.[76]\nLocust plagues can have devastating effects on human populations, causing famines and population upheavals. They are mentioned in both the Koran and the Bible and have also been held responsible for cholera epidemics, resulting from the corpses of locusts drowned in the Mediterranean Sea and decomposing on beaches.[42] The FAO and other organisations monitor locust activity around the world. Timely application of pesticides can prevent nomadic bands of hoppers from forming before dense swarms of adults can build up.[77] Besides conventional control using contact insecticides,[77] biological pest control using the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum, which specifically infects grasshoppers, has been used with some success.[78]\nIn literature\n\nThe Egyptian word for locust or grasshopper was written sn\u1e25m in the consonantal hieroglyphic writing system. The pharaoh Ramesses II compared the armies of the Hittites to locusts: \"They covered the mountains and valleys and were like locusts in their multitude.\"[79]\nOne of Aesop's Fables, later retold by La Fontaine, is the tale of The Ant and the Grasshopper. The ant works hard all summer, while the grasshopper plays. In winter, the ant is ready but the grasshopper starves. Somerset Maugham's short story \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\" explores the fable's symbolism via complex framing.[80] Other human weaknesses besides improvidence have become identified with the grasshopper's behaviour.[65] So an unfaithful woman (hopping from man to man) is \"a grasshopper\" in \"Poprygunya\", an 1892 short story by Anton Chekhov,[81] and in Jerry Paris's 1969 film The Grasshopper.[82][83]\nIn mechanical engineering\n\nThe name \"Grasshopper\" was given to the Aeronca L-3 and Piper L-4 light aircraft, both used for reconnaissance and other support duties in World War II. The name is said to have originated when Major General Innis P. Swift saw a Piper making a rough landing and remarked that it looked like a \"damned grasshopper\" for its bouncing progress.[83][84][85]\nGrasshopper beam engines were beam engines pivoted at one end, the long horizontal arm resembling the hind leg of a grasshopper. The type was patented by William Freemantle in 1803.[86][87][88]\nSee also\n(Order including grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, and grigs)\nNotes\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n Media related to Caelifera at Wikimedia Commons\n Quotations related to Grasshoppers at Wikiquote\n Data related to Caelifera at Wikispecies\n The dictionary definition of grasshopper at Wiktionary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"fc6a86a9-fcdb-44ec-bc49-b2037ad15199"}

Texas and USS<i>Maine,[lower-alpha 1] commissioned three years later, were part of the New Navy program of the late 19th century, a proposal by then Secretary of the Navy William H. Hunt to match Europe's navies that ignited a years-long debate that was suddenly settled in Hunt's favor when the Brazilian Empire commissioned the battleship Riachuelo.[1][2][3][4] In 1890, Alfred Thayer Mahan's book The Influence of Sea Power upon History was published and significantly influenced future naval policy\u2014as an indirect of its influence on Secretary Benjamin F. Tracy, the Navy Act of June 30, 1890 [5] authorized the construction of \"three sea-going, coast-line battle ships\" which became the Indiana-class. The Navy Act of July 19, 1892 authorized construction of a fourth \"sea-going, coast-line battle ship\", which became USS<i>Iowa.[6] Despite much later claims that these were to be purely defensive and were authorized as \"coastal defense ships\", they were almost immediately used for offensive operations in the Spanish\u2013American War.[7][8] By the start of the 20th century, the United States Navy had in service or under construction the three Illinois-class and two Kearsarge-class battleships, making the United States the world's 5th strongest power at sea from a nation that had been 12th in 1870.[9]\nExcept for Kearsarge, named by an act of Congress, all U.S. Navy battleships have been named for states, and each of the 48 contiguous states has had at least one battleship named for it except Montana; two battleships were authorized to be named Montana but both were cancelled before construction started. Alaska and Hawaii did not become states until 1959, after the end of battleship building, but the battlecruiser, or \"Large Cruiser,\" USS<i>Alaska was built during World War II and her sister, USS<i>Hawaii, was begun but never completed. The pre-dreadnoughts USS Zrinyi (formerly the Austrian SMS Zr\u00ednyi), USS Radetzky (formerly the Austrian SMS Radetzky), and USS Ostfriesland (formerly the German SMS Ostfriesland), taken as prizes of war after World War I, were commissioned in the US Navy, but were not assigned hull classification symbols.\nNo American battleship has ever been lost at sea, though four were sunk during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Of these, only USS<i>Arizona(BB-39) and USS<i>Oklahoma(BB-37) were permanently destroyed as a result of enemy action. Several other battleships have been sunk as targets, and USS<i>Utah(BB-31), demilitarized and converted into a target and training ship, was permanently destroyed at Pearl Harbor. The hulk of Oklahoma was salvaged and was lost at sea while being towed to the mainland for scrapping. Two American-built pre-dreadnought battleships, USS<i>Mississippi(BB-23) and her sister USS<i>Idaho(BB-24), were sunk in 1941 by German bombers during their WWII invasion of Greece. The ships had been sold to Greece in 1914, becoming Kilkis and Lemnos respectively.\n1880s\u20131910s\nMaine and Texas were part of the \"New Navy\" program of the 1880s. They, and BB-1 to BB-4 were authorized as \"coast defense battleships\". The next group, BB-5 Kearsarge through BB-25 New Hampshire, followed general global pre-dreadnought design characteristics and entered service between 1900 and 1909. The definitive American predreadnought was the penultimate class of the type, the Connecticut-class, sporting the usual four-gun array of 12\" weapons, a very heavy intermediate and secondary battery, and a moderate tertiary battery. They were good sea boats and heavily armed and armored for their type. The final American pre-dreadnought class, the Mississippi-class second-class battleships, were a poorly thought out experiment in increasing numbers regardless of quality, and the USN quickly wished to replace them, doing so in 1914, selling them to Greece to pay for a new super-dreadnought USS<i>Idaho(BB-42).\nThe dreadnoughts, BB-26 South Carolina through BB-35 Texas, commissioned between 1910 and 1914, uniformly possessed twin turrets, introduced the superimposed turret arrangement that would later become standard on all battleships, and had relatively heavy armor and moderate speed (19\u201321 knots). Five of the ten ships favored the more mature vertical triple expansion (VTE) propulsion over fuel-inefficient but faster direct-drive turbines. The ships possessed 8 (South Carolina-class), 10 (Delaware and Florida) or 12 (Wyoming-class) 12\" guns, or 10 (New York-class) 14\" guns. The dreadnoughts gave good service, the last two classes surviving through World War II before being scrapped. However, they had some faults that were never worked out, and the midships turrets in the ten and twelve-gun ships were located near boilers and high-pressure steam lines, a factor that made refrigeration very difficult and problematic in hot climates. One of their number, Texas (BB-35), is the last remaining American battleship of the pre\u2013World War II era and the only remaining dreadnought in the world.\nNext came the twelve Standards, beginning with BB-36 Nevada. The last ship commissioned was BB-48 West Virginia (BB-49 through 54 were also Standards, but were never commissioned, and scrapped under the Washington Naval Treaty), commissioned over the period 1914 to 1920. Oklahoma (BB-37) was the last American battleship commissioned with triple expansion machinery; all the other Standards used either geared steam turbines (Nevada, the Pennsylvania-class, Idaho and Mississippi) or turbo-electric propulsion (New Mexico, Tennessee through West Virginia). The Standards were a group of ships with four turrets, oil fuel, a 21-knot top speed, a 700-yard tactical diameter at top speed, and heavy armor distributed on the \"All or Nothing\" principle. Armament was fairly consistent, starting with ten 14\" guns in the Nevada-class, twelve in the Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Tennessee classes, and eight 16\" guns in the Colorado-class.\n1930s\u20131940s\nAfter the 1930s \"builders holiday,\" the USN commissioned ten more battleships of an entirely new style, the so-called fast battleship. These ships began with BB-55 North Carolina and the last ship laid down was BB-66 Kentucky (the last completed ship was BB-64 Wisconsin). These ships were a nearly clean break from previous American design practices. All ten ships were built to a Panamax design (technically post-Panamax, as they exceeded normal Panamax beam by two feet, but they were still able to transit the canal). They were fast battleships, and could travel with the aircraft carriers at cruising speed (their speed was not intended for that role, but rather so they could run down and destroy enemy battlecruisers). They possessed almost completely homogeneous main armament (nine 16\" guns in each ship, the sole difference being an increase in length from 45 to 50 calibers with the Iowa-class vessels), very high speed relative to other American designs (28 knots in the North Carolina and South Dakota classes, 33 in the Iowa-class), and moderate armor. The North Carolina-class was of particular concern, as their protection was rated as only \"adequate\" against the 16\" superheavy weapon. They had been designed with, and armored against, a battery of three quadruple 14\" guns, then changed to triple 16\" guns after the escalator clause in the Second London Naval Treaty had been triggered. Secondary in these ships was almost homogeneous as well: Except for South Dakota, configured as a flagship, the other nine ships of this group sported a uniform 20-gun 5\" secondary battery (South Dakota deleted two 5\" mounts to make room for flag facilities). Visually, the World War II ships are distinguished by their triple-turret arrangement and the massive columnar mast that dominates their superstructure. The last ship, Wisconsin (BB-64), commissioned in 1944 (Wisconsin was approved last; however, Missouri (BB-63) was commissioned 3 months later, due to delays from additional aircraft carrier construction). Missouri (BB-63), famous for being the ship on which the Japanese instrument of surrender was signed, was the last battleship in the world to be decommissioned on 31 March 1992. Seven of these ten ships are still in existence. South Dakota, Washington and Indiana were scrapped, but the remainder are now museum ships. There was intended to be another class of five of these ships, the Montana-class (BB-67 Montana through BB-71 Louisiana), but they were cancelled before being laid down in favor of a greater number of aircraft carriers. The Montana-class ships would have been built to a 60,000-ton post-Panamax design, and carried a greater number of guns (12x 16\") and heavier armor than the other ships; otherwise they would have been homogeneous with the rest of the World War II battleships.\nIn October 2006, the last battleships, (USS<i>Iowa and USS Wisconsin), were stricken from the Naval Registry.\nKey\n\nCoastal-defense battleships\nUSS Texas (1892)\n\n\nThe acquisition of modern, European-built warships by Argentina, Brazil, and Chile had alarmed the United States. The straw that broke the camel's back was Brazil's commissioning of the battleship Riachuelo, which suddenly made the Brazilian Navy the strongest in the Americas. Congressman Hilary A. Herbert, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, said of the situation, \"if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by the Riachuelo it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the American flag would get into port.\" Facing the possibility of enemy ironclads operating in American coastal waters, the Naval Consulting Board began planning a pair of ironclads of their own, which would be able to use all major American naval bases and have a minimum speed of 17 knots (31km\/h; 20mph). The first of these two was USS Texas, 308feet 10inches (94.13m) long, sporting an armor belt 12 inches (305mm) thick, displacing 6,316 long tons (6,417t), sailing at a top speed of 17.8 knots (33.0km\/h; 20.5mph), and armed with two 35-caliber 12in (305mm) primary and six 30-caliber 6in (152mm) secondary guns.[10]\nTexas was authorized by Congress on 3 August 1886, but construction lagged until she was laid down on 1 June 1889. She was launched in the presence of the granddaughter of Sam Houston on 28 June 1892, and commissioned on 15 August 1895.[11] Texas's early service revealed a number of structural issues, which was addressed via some reinforcement of various parts of the ship,[12] and she ran aground near Newport, Rhode Island in September 1896.[13]This in turn revealed even more faults with Texas, as massive flooding easily disabled her in the shallow waters where she ran aground.[14] After repairs, she joined the North Atlantic Squadron, briefly leaving for a Gulf Coast visit to Galveston and New Orleans that saw her beached on a mud bank off Galveston, an event whose aftermath gave Texas her nickname, \"Old Hoodoo.\"[15][16] After repairs, she returned to the North Atlantic Squadron and her patrols of the Eastern Seaboard. In the Spring of 1898, Texas's near-sister ship USS<i>Maine(ACR-1) (the other of the two original coastal defense ships) was destroyed by an internal explosion in Havana's harbor, and the United States went to war with the Spanish Empire. An American fleet including Texas was ready and waiting at Key West, and was part of the Flying Squadron in its engagements with Spanish fortifications on the Cuban coast. She saw real surface fleet combat on 3 July at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba alongside USS<i>Iowa, USS<i>Gloucester, and USS<i>Indiana against the fleet of Pascual Cervera y Topete as it tried to escape the American fleet and emerged with only light damage.[11][17] After the war, Texas was decommissioned and refitted on two occasions before finally be declared obsolete in 1911 and permanently decommissioned and converted into a target ship in the same year.[18][19] On 15 February 1911, Texas was christen San Marcos to free the name up for the dreadnought USS<i>Texas(BB-35),[11] and was then sunk in the waters of Tangier Sound by USS<i>New Hampshire's guns. The remains of the San Marcos continued to be used for gunnery practice after her sinking until January 1959,[20] when vast quantities of explosives were used to bury her remains.[21]\n\n\nIndiana-class\n\n\n\n\nUSS Iowa\n\n\n\n\nPredreadnought battleships\nKearsarge-class\n\n\n\n\nIllinois-class\n\n\nDisplacement: 11,565 tons\nArmament: 4 \u00d7 13 in (330mm) (2x2), 14 \u00d7 6 in (152mm) (14x1), 16 \u00d7 6 pounders (2.7kg) (16x1), 6 \u00d7 1 pounders (454 g) (6x1), 4 torpedo tubes\nSpeed: 17 knots\nShips in class: 3: USS<i>Illinois, USS<i>Alabama, and USS<i>Wisconsin\nCommissioned: 16 October 1900 (Alabama)\nDecommissioned 15 May 1920 (Illinois, Wisconsin)\nFate: Illinois transferred to New York Naval Militia 1921, renamed Prairie State 1941, scrapped 1956; Alabama sunk as target 1921; Wisconsin scrapped 1922.\n\n\nMaine-class\n\n\n\n\nVirginia-class\n\nDisplacement: 15,000 tons\nArmament: 4 \u00d7 12 in (305mm) (2x2), 8 \u00d7 8 in (203mm) (4x2), 12 \u00d7 6 in (152mm) guns (12x1), 24 1-pounders (24x1), 4 \u00d7 21 in (533mm) torpedo tubes\nArmor: Belt 11inches; Turret 12inches; Deck 3inches\nSpeed: 19 knots\nShips in class: 5: USS<i>Virginia, USS<i>Nebraska, USS<i>Georgia, USS<i>New Jersey, and USS<i>Rhode Island\nCommissioned: 19 February 1906 (Rhode Island)\nDecommissioned: 13 August 1920 (Virginia)\nFate: Virginia and New Jersey sunk as targets, remainder sold for scrap, 1923\n\n\nConnecticut-class\n\nDisplacement: 16,000 tons\nArmament: 4 \u00d7 12 in (305mm) (2x2), 8 \u00d7 8 in (203mm) (4x2), 12 \u00d7 7 in (178mm) (12x1), 10 \u00d7 3 in (76mm) (10x1), 4 \u00d7 21 in (533mm) torpedo tubes\nArmor: 11in Belt \/ 3in Deck\nSpeed: 18 knots\nShips in class: 6: USS<i>Connecticut, USS<i>Louisiana, USS<i>Vermont, USS<i>Kansas, USS<i>Minnesota, and USS<i>New Hampshire\nCommissioned: 2 June 1906 (Louisiana)\nDecommissioned: 1 March 1923 (Connecticut)\nFate: Scrapped 1923-24\n\n\nMississippi-class\n\nDisplacement: 13,000 tons\nArmament: 4 \u00d7 12 in (305mm) (2 \u00d7 2), 8 \u00d7 8 in (203mm) (4 \u00d7 2), 8 \u00d7 7 in (178mm) (8x1), 12 \u00d7 3 in (76mm) (12 \u00d7 1), 6 \u00d7 3 pounder gun (6 \u00d7 1), 2 \u00d7 1-pounder Mark 6 (2 \u00d7 1), 6 \u00d7 .30-caliber machine guns (6 \u00d7 1), 2 \u00d7 21 in (533mm) torpedo tubes\nArmor:\nSpeed: 17 knots\nShips in class: 2: USS<i>Mississippi and USS<i>Idaho\nCommissioned: 1 February 1908 (Mississippi)\nFate: Decommissioned 30 July 1914 and sold to Greece.

{"question":"Where is Monte Carlo?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1],"passage_indices":[-1],"start_positions":[-1],"yes_no_answer":["NONE"]},"context":["\n\n\nMonte Carlo (\/\u02c8m\u0252nti\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0rlo\u028a\/; Italian:[\u02c8monte \u02c8karlo]; French: Monte-Carlo [m\u0254\u0303te ka\u0281lo], or colloquially Monte-Carl [m\u0254\u0303te ka\u0281l]; Mon\u00e9gasque: Munte Carlu) officially refers to an administrative area of the Principality of Monaco, specifically the ward of Monte Carlo\/Sp\u00e9lugues, where the Monte Carlo Casino is located. Informally the name also refers to a larger district, the Monte Carlo Quarter (corresponding to the former municipality of Monte Carlo), which besides Monte Carlo\/Sp\u00e9lugues also includes the wards of La Rousse\/Saint Roman, Larvotto\/Bas Moulins, and Saint Michel. The permanent population of the ward of Monte Carlo is about 3,500, while that of the quarter is about 15,000. Monaco has four traditional quarters. From west to east they are: Fontvieille (the newest), Monaco-Ville (the oldest), La Condamine, and Monte Carlo.\nMonte Carlo (literally \"Mount Charles\") is situated on a prominent escarpment at the base of the Maritime Alps along the French Riviera. Near the quarter's western end is the world-famous Place du Casino, the gambling center which has made Monte Carlo \"an international byword for the extravagant display and reckless dispersal of wealth\".[1] It is also the location of the H\u00f4tel de Paris, the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, and the Salle Garnier (the casino theatre which is the home of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo).\nThe quarter's eastern part includes the community of Larvotto with Monaco's only public beach, as well as its new convention center (the Grimaldi Forum), and the Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort. At the quarter's eastern border, one crosses into the French town of Beausoleil (sometimes referred to as Monte-Carlo-Sup\u00e9rieur), and just 8 kilometres (5mi) to its east is the western border of Italy.\nHistory\n\n\nBy the 1850s Monaco's reigning family was almost bankrupt; this was a result of the loss of two towns, Menton and Roquebrune, which had provided most of the principality\u2019s revenues with their lemon, orange and olive crops.[2] At the time, a number of small towns in Europe were growing prosperous from the establishment of casinos, notably in German towns such as Baden-Baden and Homburg.\nIn 1856 Charles\u00a0III of Monaco granted a concession to Napoleon Langlois and Albert Aubert to establish a sea-bathing facility for the treatment of various diseases, and to build a German-style casino in Monaco.[2] The initial casino was opened in La Condamine in 1862, but was not a success; its present location in the area called \"Les Sp\u00e9lugues\" (The Caves) of Monte Carlo, came only after several relocations in the years that followed. The success of the casino grew slowly, largely due to the area's inaccessibility from much of Europe. The installation of the railway in 1868, however, brought with it an influx of people into Monte Carlo and saw it grow in wealth.[2]\nSaint-Charles Church on Monte Carlo's Avenue Sainte-Charles was completed in 1883. It was restored in its centenary year.[3][4]\nIn 1911 when the Constitution divided the principality of Monaco in three municipalities, the municipality of Monte Carlo was created covering the existing neighborhoods of La Rousse\/Saint Roman, Larvotto\/Bas Moulins and Saint Michel. The municipalities were merged into one in 1917, after accusations that the government was acting according to the motto \"divide and conquer\" and they were accorded the status of wards (quartiers) thereafter. Today, Monaco is divided into 10 wards, with an eleventh ward planned (but currently postponed) to encompass land reclaimed from the sea (see the \"Administrative Divisions\" section of Monaco for additional details).\nThe quarter of Monte Carlo was served by tramways from 1900 to 1953, linking all parts of Monaco (see transportation in Monaco). In 2003 a new cruise ship pier was completed in the harbour at Monte Carlo.\nGeography\nClimate\nMonte Carlo has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), which is influenced by oceanic climate and humid subtropical climate. As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters.[5]\n\n\n\nSport and leisure\n\nMonte Carlo is host to most of the Circuit de Monaco, on which the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix takes place. It also hosts world championship boxing bouts, the European Poker Tour Grand Final and the World Backgammon Championship as well as the Monaco International Auto Show (Fr: Salon International de l'Automobile de Monaco[9]), fashion shows and other events. Although the Monte Carlo Masters tennis tournament is billed as taking place in the community, its actual location is in the adjacent French commune of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. Monte Carlo has been visited by royalty as well as the public and movie stars for decades. The Monte Carlo Rally is one of the longest running and most respected car rallies; from 1973 to 2008 and again from 2012, it marks the start of World Rally Championship season, having also served as the curtain-raiser for the Intercontinental Rally Challenge between 2009 and 2011. The rally, however, takes place outside the Monte Carlo quarter and is run mostly on French roads.\nMonte Carlo is one of Europe's leading tourist resorts, although many of the key tourist destinations are in other parts of Monaco, including such attractions as Monaco Cathedral, the Napoleon Museum, the Oceanographic Museum and aquarium, and the Prince's Palace, all of which are in Monaco-Ville.\nSalle Garnier\n\nThe Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo or Salle Garnier was built to designs of the architect Charles Garnier, who also designed the Paris opera house now known as the Palais Garnier. Although much smaller, the Salle Garnier is very similar in style with decorations in red and gold, and frescoes and sculptures all around the auditorium. It was inaugurated on 25 January 1879 with a performance by Sarah Bernhardt dressed as a nymph. The first opera performed there was Robert Planquette's Le Chevalier Gaston on 8 February 1879, and that was followed by three more in the first season.\nWith the influence of the first director, Jules Cohen (who was instrumental in bringing Adelina Patti) and the fortunate combination of Raoul Gunsbourg, the new director from 1883, and Princess Alice, the opera-loving American wife of CharlesIII's successor, AlbertI, the company was thrust onto the world's opera community stage. Gunsbourg had remained for sixty years.\nBy the early years of the twentieth century, the Salle Garnier was to see such great performers as Nellie Melba and Enrico Caruso in La Boh\u00e8me and Rigoletto (in 1902), and Feodor Chaliapin in the premiere of Jules Massenet's Don Quichotte (1910). This production formed part of a long association between the company and Massenet and his operas, two of which were presented there posthumously.\nOther famous twentieth-century singers to appear at Monte Carlo included Titta Ruffo, Geraldine Farrar, Mary Garden, Tito Schipa, Beniamino Gigli, Claudia Muzio, Georges Thill, and Lily Pons.\nApart from Massenet, composers whose works had their first performances at Monte Carlo included: Saint-Sa\u00ebns (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, 1904);  Mascagni (Amica, 1905); and Puccini (La rondine, 1917). Indeed, since its inauguration, the theatre has hosted 45 world premiere productions of operas. Ren\u00e9 Blum was retained to found the Ballet de l'Op\u00e9ra. The \"Golden Age\" of the Salle Garnier is gone, as small companies with small houses are not able to mount productions that cost astronomical sums. Nonetheless, the present day company still presents a season containing five or six operas.\nTwin cities\nCampagna, Italy and Ceuta, Spain are Monte Carlo's twin cities.\nH\u00f4tel de Paris\n\n\nThe H\u00f4tel de Paris, established in 1864 by Charles\u00a0III of Monaco, is located on the west side of the Place du Casino in the heart of Monte Carlo. It belongs to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco (SBM), and is part of the elite Palace Grand Hotels in Monaco with the Hotel Hermitage, the Monte-Carlo Beach Hotel on Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort, the Metropole Hotel and Fairmont hotel.\nThe hotel has 106 rooms divided into four groups based on type of view, decoration and luxury.[10] The Exclusive City View offers 20 rooms, the Superior Courtyard has 29 large rooms, the Exclusive Sea View 59 and the Exclusive Casino has six.\nAdditionally, there are 74 suites and junior suites which are grouped similarly, offering more luxury than the rooms. There are single and double suites as well as courtyard junior suites and Sea\/Casino Junior suites.[10] There is also one Presidential suite.[11]\nA project to renovate the hotel began October 2014 to create a garden courtyard, add a new spa, fitness and pool area, exceptional suites and a \u201crooftop villa\u201d with a private garden and pool.[12]\nIn entertainment\n\nMonte Carlo has featured in numerous films and television series, most recently in the 2011 movie of the same name. Monte Carlo was the setting for the 1922 Erich von Stroheim silent film Foolish Wives although it was filmed in California.\nThe casino featured in the James Bond films Never Say Never Again (1983), and GoldenEye (1995). To Catch a Thief (1954) was an Alfred Hitchcock film with Monte Carlo and its famous casino as the setting and featured Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, the future Princess Grace of Monaco, as the stars. There is a scene in the movie where the-then Grace Kelly drives a car very quickly\u2014and dangerously\u2014along the steep winding roads of Monaco that surround the heights of Monte Carlo; an interesting coincidence to her actual fate in 1982. Monte Carlo was even a location for the late 1960s British London based series Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) wherein the eleventh episode of the series, \"The Ghost who Saved the Bank at Monte Carlo\", Mike Pratt, Kenneth Cope and Annette Andre went to Monte Carlo to accompany a highly talented elderly woman to gamble inside the casino and waylay a group of thugs (amongst them Brian Blessed). And Grand Prix (1966) was filmed here, which starred James Garner, Eva M. Saint, and Yves Montand.\nHerbie Goes to Monte Carlo (1977) starring Dean Jones & Don Knotts.\nThe motor race Monaco World Prix1 in Monte Carlo also featured in the 2010 film Iron Man\u00a02.\nOther films such as ISpy, Cars 2 and Monte Carlo use the city as a setting. The video game series Gran Turismo often features Monte Carlo as a location, and the Indie game Monaco: What's Yours is Mine features Monte Carlo as a setting.

It was formed in Cairo on 22 March 1945 with six members: Kingdom of Egypt, Kingdom of Iraq, Transjordan (renamed Jordan in 1949), Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.[3] Yemen joined as a member on 5 May 1945. Currently, the League has 22 members, but Syria's participation has been suspended since November 2011, as a consequence of government repression during the Syrian Civil War.[4]\nThe League's main goal is to \"draw closer the relations between member States and co-ordinate collaboration between them, to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, and to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries\".[5]\nThrough institutions, such as the Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (ALECSO) and the Economic and Social Council of the Arab League's Council of Arab Economic Unity (CAEU), the Arab League facilitates political, economic, cultural, scientific, and social programmes designed to promote the interests of the Arab world.[6][7] It has served as a forum for the member states to coordinate their policy positions, to deliberate on matters of common concern, to settle some Arab disputes and to limit conflicts such as the 1958 Lebanon crisis. The League has served as a platform for the drafting and conclusion of many landmark documents promoting economic integration. One example is the Joint Arab Economic Action Charter, which outlines the principles for economic activities in the region.\n\nEach member state has one vote in the League Council, and decisions are binding only for those states that have voted for them. The aims of the league in 1945 were to strengthen and coordinate the political, cultural, economic and social programs of its members and to mediate disputes among them or between them and third parties. Furthermore, the signing of an agreement on Joint Defence and Economic Cooperation on 13 April 1950 committed the signatories to coordination of military defence measures. In March 2015, the Arab League General Secretary announced the establishment of a Joint Arab Force with the aim of counteracting extremism and other threats to the Arab States. The decision was reached while Operation Decisive Storm was intensifying in Yemen. Participation in the project is voluntary, and the army intervenes only at the request of one of the member states. The growing militarization of the region and the increase in violent civil wars as well as terrorist movements are the reason behind the creation of the JAF, financed by the rich Gulf countries.[8]\nIn the early 1970s, the Economic Council of the League of Arab States put forward a proposal to create the Joint Arab Chambers of Commerce across the European states. That led, under the decree of the League of Arab States no. K1175\/D52\/G, to the decision by the Arab governments to set up the Arab British Chamber of Commerce which was mandated to \"promote, encourage and facilitate bilateral trade\" between the Arab world and its major trading partner, the United Kingdom.\nHistory\n\nFollowing adoption of the Alexandria Protocol in 1944, the Arab League was founded on 22 March 1945. It aimed to be a regional organisation of Arab states with a focus to developing the economy, resolving disputes and coordinating political aims.[9] Other countries later joined the league.[10] Each country was given one vote in the council. The first major action was the joint intervention, allegedly on behalf of the majority Arab population being uprooted as the state of Israel emerged in 1948 (and in response to popular protest in the Arab world), but a major participant in this intervention, Transjordan, had agreed with the Israelis to divide up the Arab Palestinian state proposed by the United Nations General Assembly, and Egypt intervened primarily to prevent its rival in Amman from accomplishing its objective.[11]\nIt was followed by the creation of a mutual defence treaty two years later. A common market was established in 1965.[9][12]\nGeography\n\n\nThe Arab League member states cover over 13,000,000km2 (5,000,000sqmi) and straddles two continents: Africa and Asia. The area largely consists of arid deserts, such as the Sahara. Nevertheless, it also contains several highly fertile lands like the Nile Valley, the Jubba Valley and Shebelle Valley in the Horn of Africa, the Atlas Mountains in the Maghreb, and the Fertile Crescent that stretches over Mesopotamia and the Levant. The area comprises deep forests in southern Arabia and parts of the world's longest river, the Nile.\nMembership\n\nThe Charter of the Arab League, also known as the Pact of the League of Arab States, is the founding treaty of the Arab League. Adopted in 1945, it stipulates that \"the League of Arab States shall be composed of the independent Arab States that have signed this Pact.\"[13]\nInitially, in 1945, there were only six members. Today, the Arab League has 22 members, including three African countries among the largest by area (Sudan, Algeria and Libya) and the largest country in the Middle East, (Saudi Arabia). \nFive countries have observer status  that entitles them to express their opinion and give advice but denies them voting rights.[14]\nThere was a continual increase in membership during the second half of the 20th century. As of 2016, there are 22 member states:\n\nAlgeria\nBahrain\nComoros\nDjibouti\nEgypt\nIraq\nJordan\nKuwait\nLebanon\nLibya\nMauritania\nMorocco\nOman\nPalestine\nQatar\nSaudi Arabia\nSomalia\nSudan\nSyria\nTunisia\nUnited Arab Emirates\nYemen\n\nand 5 observer states:\n\nBrazil\nEritrea\nIndia\nVenezuela[15]\nArmenia\n\nLibya was suspended on 22 February 2011, following the start of the Libyan Civil War and the use of military force against civilians.[16] The National Transitional Council, the partially recognised interim government of Libya, sent a representative to be seated at the Arab League meeting on 17 August to participate in a discussion as to whether to readmit Libya to the organisation.[17]\nSyria was suspended on 16 November 2011. On 6 March 2013, the Arab League gave the Syrian National Coalition Syria's seat in the Arab League.[18] On 9 March 2014, secretary general Nabil al-Arabi said that Syria's seat would remain vacant until the opposition completes the formation of its institutions.[19]\nPolitics and administration\n\n\n\nThe Arab League is a political organization which tries to help integrate its members economically, and solve conflicts involving member states without asking for foreign assistance. It possesses elements of a state representative parliament while foreign affairs are often conducted under UN supervision.\nThe Charter of the Arab League[5] endorsed the principle of an Arab homeland while respecting the sovereignty of the individual member states. The internal regulations of the Council of the League[20] and the committees[21] were agreed in October 1951. Those of the Secretariat-General were agreed in May 1953.[22]\nSince then, governance of the Arab League has been based on the duality of supra-national institutions and the sovereignty of the member states. Preservation of individual statehood derived its strengths from the natural preference of ruling elites to maintain their power and independence in decision making. Moreover, the fear of the richer that the poorer may share their wealth in the name of Arab nationalism, the feuds among Arab rulers, and the influence of external powers that might oppose Arab unity can be seen as obstacles towards a deeper integration of the league.\nMindful of their previous announcements in support of the Arabs of Palestine the framers of the Pact were determined to include them within the League from its inauguration.[23] This was done by means of an annex that declared:[5]\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEven though Palestine was not able to control her own destiny, it was on the basis of the recognition of her independence that the Covenant of the League of Nations determined a system of government for her. Her existence and her independence among the nations can, therefore, no more be questioned de jure than the independence of any of the other Arab States. [...] Therefore, the States signatory to the Pact of the Arab League consider that in view of Palestine's special circumstances, the Council of the League should designate an Arab delegate from Palestine to participate in its work until this country enjoys actual independence\u201d\nAt the Cairo Summit of 1964, the Arab League initiated the creation of an organisation representing the Palestinian people. The first Palestinian National Council convened in East Jerusalem on 29 May 1964. The Palestinian Liberation Organization was founded during this meeting on 2 June 1964. Palestine was shortly admitted in to the Arab League, represented by the PLO. Today, State of Palestine is a full member of the Arab League.\nAt the Beirut Summit on 28 March 2002, the league adopted the Arab Peace Initiative,[24] a Saudi-inspired peace plan for the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. The initiative offered full normalisation of the relations with Israel. In exchange, Israel was required to withdraw from all occupied territories, including the Golan Heights, to recognise Palestinian independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, as well as a \"just solution\" for the Palestinian refugees. The Peace Initiative was again endorsed at 2007 in the Riyadh Summit. In July 2007, the Arab League sent a mission, consisting of the Jordanian and Egyptian foreign ministers, to Israel to promote the initiative. Following Venezuela's move to expel Israeli diplomats amid the 2008\u20132009 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict, Kuwaiti member of parliament Waleed Al-Tabtabaie proposed moving Arab League headquarters to Caracas, Venezuela.[25] On 13 June 2010, Amr Mohammed Moussa, Secretary-General of the Arab League, visited the Gaza Strip, the first visit by an official of the Arab League since Hamas' armed takeover in 2007.\nIn 2015, the Arab League voiced support for Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the 2011 uprising.[26]\nOn 15 April 2018, in response to the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed at ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin, the Arab League passed a resolution calling on Turkish forces to withdraw from Afrin.[27]\nSummits\n\n\nMilitary\n\nThe Joint Defence Council of the Arab League is one of the Institutions of the Arab League.[33] It was established under the terms of the Joint Defence and Economic Co-operation Treaty of 1950 to coordinate the joint defence of the Arab League member states.[34]\nThe Arab League as an Organization has no military Force, like the UN or EU, but at the 2007 summit, the Leaders decided to reactivate their joint defense and establish a peacekeeping force to deploy in South Lebanon, Darfur, Iraq, and other hot spots.\nAt a 2015 summit in Egypt, member nations agreed in principle to form a joint military force.[35]\nEmergency summits\n\n\nTwo summits are not added to the system of Arab League summits:\nAnshas, Egypt: 28\u201329 May 1946.\nBeirut, Lebanon: 13\u2013 15 November 1958.\nSummit 14 in Fes, Morocco, occurred in two stages:\nOn 25 November 1981: the 5-hour meeting ended without an agreement on document.\nOn 6\u20139 September 1982.\n\nEconomic resources\n\n\n\nThe Arab League is rich in resources, such as enormous oil and natural gas resources in certain member states. Another industry that is growing steadily in the Arab League is telecommunications. Within less than a decade, local companies such as Orascom and Etisalat have managed to compete internationally.\nEconomic achievements initiated by the League amongst member states have been less impressive than those achieved by smaller Arab organisations such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).[36] Among them is the Arab Gas Pipeline, that will transport Egyptian and Iraqi gas to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. As of 2013, a significant difference in economic conditions exist between the developed oil states of Algeria, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE, and developing countries like Comoros, Djibouti, Mauritania, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nThe Arab League also includes great fertile lands in the southern part of Sudan. It is referred to as the food basket of the Arab World, the region's instability including the independence of South Sudan has not affected its tourism industry, that is considered the fastest growing industry in the region, with Egypt, UAE, Lebanon, Tunisia, and Jordan leading the way. Another industry that is growing steadily in the Arab League is telecommunications.\nEconomical achievements within members have been low in the league's history, other smaller Arab Organizations have achieved more than the league has, such as the GCC, but lately several major economic projects that are promising are to be completed, the Arab Gas Pipeline is to end by the year 2010, Connecting Egyptian and Iraqi Gas to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and then to Turkey thus Europe, a free trade Agreement (GAFTA) is to be completed by 1 January 2008, making 95% of all Arab Products tax free of customs.\nTransport\n\nThe Arab League is divided into five parts when it comes to transport, with the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East being entirely connected by air, sea, roads and railways. Another part of the League is the Nile Valley, made up of Egypt and Sudan. These two member states have started to improve the River Nile's navigation system to improve accessibility and thus foster trading. A new railway system is also set to connect the southern Egyptian city of Abu Simbel with the northern Sudanese city of Wadi Halfa and then to Khartoum and Port Sudan. The third division of the League is the Maghreb, where a 3,000km stretch of railway runs from the southern cities of Morocco to Tripoli in Western Libya. The fourth division of the League is the Horn of Africa, whose member states include Djibouti and Somalia. These two Arab League states are separated by only ten nautical miles from the Arabian Peninsula by the Bab el Mandeb and this is quickly changing as Tarik bin Laden, the brother of Osama bin Laden, has initiated the construction of the ambitious Bridge of the Horns project, which ultimately aims to connect the Horn of Africa with the Arabian Peninsula via a massive bridge. The project is intended to facilitate and accelerate the already centuries-old trade and commerce between the two regions. The last division of the League is the isolated island of Comoros, which is not physically connected to any other Arab state, but still trades with other League members.\nLiteracy in Arab league countries\n\n\n\nIn collecting literacy data, many countries estimate the number of literate people based on self-reported data. Some use educational attainment data as a proxy, but measures of school attendance or grade completion may differ. Because definitions and data collection methods vary across countries, literacy estimates should be used with caution. United Nations Development Programme, Human Development Report 2010. It is also important to note that the Persian Gulf region has had an oil boom, enabling more schools and universities to be set up.\n\nDemographics\n\nThe Arab League is a culturally and ethnically one association of 22 member states, with the overwhelming majority of the League's population identified as Arab (on a cultural ethnoracial basis). As of July 1, 2013, about 359 million people live in the states of the Arab League. Its population grows faster than in most other global regions. The most populous member state is Egypt, with a population of about 91 million.[40] The least populated is the Comoros, with over 0.6 million inhabitants.\n\nSyrian demographics are before the Syrian civil war.\nReligion\nAlmost all of the Arab League's citizens adhere to Islam, with Christianity being the second largest religion. At least 15 million Christians combined live in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Sudan and Syria. In addition, there are smaller but significant numbers of Druze, Yazidis, Shabaks and Mandaeans. Numbers for nonreligious Arabs are generally not available, but research by the Pew Forum suggests around 1% of people in the MENA region are \"unaffiliated\".[50]\nLinguistics\nThe official language of the Arab League is Literary Arabic, based on Classical Arabic. However, several Arab League member states have other co-official or national languages, such as  Somali, Berber, Kurdish, Assyrian, and  Nubian. Additionally, various different Arabic dialects are spoken, such as Egyptian Arabic, Levantine Arabic and Moroccan Arabic.\nCulture\nSports\n\nThe Pan Arab Games are considered the biggest Arab sporting event, which brings together athletes from all the Arab countries to participate in a variety of different sports.\nThe Union of Arab Football Associations organises the Arab Nations Cup (for national teams) and the Arab Club Champions Cup (for clubs). Arab sport federations also exist for several games, include basketball, volleyball, handball, table tennis, tennis, squash and swimming.\nSee also\n\n\nArab Charter on Human Rights\nArab Cold War\nArab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD)\nArab leaders\nArab League and the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict\nArab League boycott of Israel\nArab Maghreb Union (UMA)\nArab Monetary Fund\nArab Organization for Industrialization\nArab Parliament\nArab Union\nBloudan Conference (1937)\nCouncil of Arab Economic Unity (CAEU)\nFlag of the Arab League\nGeneral Arab Insurance Federation\nGeneral Union of Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture for Arab Countries\nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC)\nInternational Association of Arabic Dialectology (AIDA)\nInternational Confederation of Arab Trade Unions\nList of conflicts in the Arab League\nList of country groupings\nList of largest cities in the Arab world\nList of multilateral free-trade agreements\nList of tallest buildings in the Arab League\nLists of the Arab League\nModel Arab League\nOrange card system \u2013 motor insurance scheme of the Arab League\nOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation\nOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC)\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)\nPan Arab Games\nPan-Arabism\nSummit of South American-Arab Countries\nUnited Arab Command\nArab Standardization and Metrology Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in Arabic)  (official site).\n(in English)  in Washington D.C. \u2013 USA\n at Al-Bab.com\n at Council on Foreign Relations\n, BBC News, updated 9 August 2011\n at Jewish Virtual Library\n at WorldStatesmen.org\n in Qatar (in English)\n at Bursa\n\n collected news and commentary at The Jerusalem Post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"3a06e512-c7aa-4727-8576-4bf2313341e1"}

It covers three phases. Firstly, the emergence of organised lodges of operative masons during the Middle Ages, then the admission of lay members as \"accepted\" masons (a term reflecting the ceremonial \u201cacception\u201d process that made non stone masons members of an operative lodge) or speculative masons, and finally the evolution of purely speculative lodges, and the emergence of Grand Lodges to govern them. The watershed in this process is generally taken to be the formation of the first Grand Lodge in London in 1717. The two difficulties facing historians are the paucity of written material, even down to the 19th century, and the misinformation generated by masons and non-masons alike from the earliest years.\nA complete history of Freemasonry is beyond the scope of a single article. This article traces the early development of Freemasonry from organised bodies of operative stonemasons to the modern system of speculative lodges organised around regional or national \"Grand Lodges\". Notable events and developments of the modern period are also briefly described. The history of specific subjects, rites and jurisdictions within the general heading of Freemasonry is dealt with in detail elsewhere, in their own articles.\nOrigin myths and theories\nEarly Masonic sources\nThe earliest masonic texts each contain some sort of a history of the craft, or mystery, of masonry. The oldest known work of this type, The Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem, dates from between 1390 and 1425. This document has a brief history in its introduction, stating that the \"craft of masonry\" began with Euclid in Egypt, and came to England in the reign of King Athelstan (born about 894, died 27 October 939).[1] Shortly afterwards, the Cooke Manuscript traces masonry to Jabal son of Lamech (Genesis 4: 20\u201322), and tells how this knowledge came to Euclid, from him to the Children of Israel (while they were in Egypt), and so on through an elaborate path to Athelstan.[2] This myth formed the basis for subsequent manuscript constitutions, all tracing masonry back to biblical times, and fixing its institutional establishment in England during the reign of Athelstan (927\u2013939).[3]\nShortly after the formation of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, James Anderson was commissioned to digest these \"Gothic Constitutions\" in a palatable, modern form. The resulting constitutions are prefaced by a history more extensive than any before, again tracing the history of what was now freemasonry back to biblical roots, again forging Euclid into the chain. True to his material, Anderson fixes the first grand assembly of English Masons at York, under Athelstan's son, Edwin, who is otherwise unknown to history.[4] Expanded, revised, and republished, Anderson's 1738 constitutions listed the Grand Masters since Augustine of Canterbury, listed as Austin the Monk.[5] William Preston's Illustrations of Freemasonry enlarged and expanded on this masonic creation myth.[6]\nIn France, the 1737 lecture of Chevalier Ramsay added the crusaders to the lineage. He maintained that Crusader Masons had revived the craft with secrets recovered in the Holy Land, under the patronage of the Knights Hospitaller. At this point, the \"history\" of the craft in Continental Freemasonry diverged from that in England.[7]\nSpeculative histories\nAnderson's histories of 1723 and 1738, Ramsay's romanticisation, together with the internal allegory of masonic ritual, centred on King Solomon\u2019s Temple and its architect, Hiram Abiff, have provided ample material for further speculation.\nThe earliest known ritual places the first masonic lodge in the porchway of King Solomon\u2019s Temple.[8] Following Anderson, it has also been possible to trace Freemasonry to Euclid, Pythagoras, Moses, the Essenes, and the Culdees.[9] Preston started his history with the Druids, while Anderson's description of masons as \"Noachides\", extrapolated by Albert Mackey, put Noah into the equation.[10]\nFollowing Ramsay's introduction of Crusader masons, the Knights Templar became involved in the myth, starting with Karl Gotthelf von Hund's Rite of Strict Observance, which also linked in the exiled House of Stuart.[11] The murder of Hiram Abiff was taken as an allegory for the death of Charles I of England. Oliver Cromwell emerges as the founder of Freemasonry in an anonymous anti-masonic work of 1745, commonly attributed to Abb\u00e9 Larudan. Mackey states that \"The propositions of Larudan are distinguished for their absolute independence of all historical authority and for the bold assumptions which are presented to the reader in the place of facts.\"[12] The anti-masonic writings of Christoph Friedrich Nicolai implicated Francis Bacon and the Rosicrucians,[13] while Christopher Wren's connection with the craft was omitted from Anderson's first book of constitutions, but appeared in the second when Wren was dead.[14]\nSimilarly, attempts to root Freemasonry in the French Compagnonnage have produced no concrete links.[15] Connections to the Roman Collegia and Comacine masters are similarly tenuous, although some Freemasons see them as exemplars rather than ancestors.[16][17] Thomas Paine traced Freemasonry to Ancient Egypt,[18] as did Cagliostro, who went so far as to supply the ritual.[13]\nMore recently, several authors have attempted to link the Templars to the timeline of Freemasonry through the imagery of the carvings in Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, where the Templars are rumoured to have sought refuge after the dissolution of the order.[19] In The Hiram Key, Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight describe a timeline starting in ancient Egypt, and taking in Jesus, the Templars, and Rosslyn before arriving at modern Freemasonry.[20]  These claims are challenged by Robert Cooper, the curator of the Grand Lodge of Scotland's library and museum, in his book The Rosslyn Hoax.[21]\nEmergence of modern masonic studies\nThe first rational study of masonic history was published in Germany, but Georg Kloss's 1847 work, Geschichte der Freimaurerei in England, Irland und Schottland was never translated.[22] When Findel's History of Freemasonry was translated from German to English in 1866, Woodford in England and Murray-Lyon in Scotland were already active writers on the subject. Woodford was Findel's guide when he visited York to inspect manuscripts, and would shortly collaborate with Hughan in collecting, dating and classifying the old manuscript constitutions.[23] Albert Mackey was no less active in America. The list of his published works start in 1844 with \"A Lexicon of Freemasonry\", and extend to his monumental Encyclopedia of Freemasonry in 1874.[24] Increasing interest, and participation, in masonic studies led, in 1886, to the formation in London of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, the first lodge dedicated to masonic research.[25]\nFrom origin to Grand Lodge Freemasonry\nOrigin of the term \"Freemason\"\nThe earliest official English documents to refer to masons are written in Latin or Norman French. Thus we have \"sculptores lapidum liberorum\" (London 1212), \"magister lathomus liberarum petrarum\" (Oxford 1391), and \"mestre mason de franche peer\" (Statute of Labourers 1351). These all signify a worker in freestone, a grainless sandstone or limestone suitable for ornamental masonry. In the 17th century building accounts of Wadham College the terms freemason and freestone mason are used interchangeably. Freemason also contrasts with \"Rough Mason\" or \"Layer\", as a more skilled worker who worked or laid dressed stone.[26]\nThe adjective \"free\" in this context may also be taken to infer that the mason is not enslaved, indentured or feudally bound. While this is difficult to reconcile with medieval English masons, it apparently became important to Scottish operative lodges.[27]\nMaster Masons in medieval England\nA medieval Master Mason would be required to undergo what passed for a liberal education in those days. In England, he would leave home at nine or ten years of age already literate in English and French, educated at home or at the petty (junior) school. From then until the age of fourteen, he would attend monastery or grammar school to learn Latin, or as a page in a knightly household would learn deportment in addition to his studies. Between the ages of fourteen and seventeen he would learn the basic skills of choosing, shaping, and combining stone and then between the ages of 17 and 21, be required to learn by rote a large number of formal problems in geometry. Three years as a journeyman would often finish with the submission of a masterwork dealing with a set problem in construction or design. At this point, he was considered qualified, but still had a career ladder to climb before attaining the status of Master Mason on a large project.[28]\nIn his function as architect, the Master Mason probably made his plans for each successive stage of a build in silverpoint on a prepared parchment or board. These would be realised on the ground by using a larger compass than the one used for drafting. Medieval architects are depicted with much larger compasses and squares where they are shown on a building site. Fine detail was transferred from the drawing board by means of wooden templates supplied to the masons.[28]\nThe Master Masons who appear in record as presiding over major works, such as York Minster, became wealthy and respected. Visiting Master Masons and Master Carpenters sat at high table of monasteries, dining with the abbott.[28]\nFrom the Middle Ages to the Reformation\nThe historical record shows two levels of organisation in medieval masonry, the lodge and the \"guild\". The original use of the word lodge indicates a workshop erected on the site of a major work, the first mention being Vale Royal Abbey in 1278. Later, it gained the secondary meaning of the community of masons in a particular place. The earliest surviving records of these are the laws and ordinances of the lodge at York Minster in 1352. It should be noted that these regulations were imposed by the Dean and Chapter of the Minster.[26]\nNineteenth-century historians imposed the term \"Guild\" on the \"fellowships\" of medieval tradesmen as an analogy with the merchant guilds. The masons were late in forming such bodies. The major employer of masons in medieval England was the crown, and the crown frequently employed masons by impressment. In other words, they were forcibly recruited when the need arose. \nThe Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem is the oldest known document of masonic origin. It was published in 1840 by Shakespearean scholar and collector James Halliwell who dated it to 1390. A. F. A. Woodford, the pioneering Masonic scholar and a founder of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, agreed with this dating.[29] More recently, historian Andrew Prescott has dated the text to the second quarter of the fifteenth century.[30]\nThe poem may be seen as a response to a stream of legislation dating back to the Black Death,  and the Statute of Labourers of 1351, in which Edward III attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels.[31] The earlier date follows the 1389 ordinance of Richard II requiring the guilds and fellowships to lay before him their Charters and Letters Patent,[31] and the second follows the more serious legislation of 1425 banning the annual assemblies of masons.[32]\nIn 1356, the preamble to regulations governing the Trade of Masons specifically states that, unlike the other trades, no body existed for the regulation of masonry by masons. Finally, in 1376, four representatives of the \"mystery\" or trade are elected to the Common Council in London. This also seems to be the first use of the word \"freemason\" in English. It was immediately struck out, and replaced with the word \"mason\".[26]\n\n\n\nThe poem claims that these assemblies were ordained by King Athelstan and that he also linked the wages of a mason to the cost of living.[29]\nThe Cooke Manuscript, dating from about 1450, set the pattern for what Anderson called the \"Gothic Constitutions\", the older histories and regulations of the craft.[2] After a brief blessing, these documents describe the seven Liberal Arts, assigning predominance to Geometry, which is equated with Masonry. They then proceed to a history of masonry\/geometry, finishing with King Athelstan, or Edwin, his brother or son depending on source, assembling England's masons to give them their charges. The regulations or charges follow, usually with instructions as to the manner in which a new mason should swear to them.[33]\nAlso around 1450 the will of a mason from Beverley gives a tantalising glimpse into the emergence of masonic regalia. An inventory of John Cadeby's possessions mentions several zona<\/i>s, or girdles. Two were silver mounted, and one of these had the letters B and I in the middle, indicating Boaz and Jachin, the twin pillars of Solomon's Temple.[34] He also owned a writing table and six English books, making him comfortably well-off and literate.[35]\nThe following century and a half produced few new manuscripts. The Dowland manuscript, whose original is now lost, and Grand Lodge No 1, for the first time locate Edwin's assembly of Masons at York. The Lansdowne,  originally dated to this period, is now thought to date from the 17th century.[30]\nIt was during this period that the Reformation occurred. It was at one time assumed that the church was the major employer of masons, and with the Dissolution of the Monasteries the lodges disappeared.[36] It was also believed that the craft \"guilds\" were abolished in England in 1547.[37] On the death of Henry VIII, Archbishop Cranmer sought to advance the reformation by the abolition of Guilds and fellowships. In 1548, \"The bill of conspiracies of victuallers and craftsmen\" was passed, revoking their monopolies. In 1549 it was repealed, presumably because they were too useful to the government.[38] The government continued to be a major employer of masons, who in London had moved from a fellowship to an incorporation. While this was not chartered until 1666, the state used it in the sixteenth century to procure and indent masons for building projects. In addition, masons were increasingly employed by private individuals.[26] The Saints day parades by the various crafts, enacting plays about their various patron saints, were however suppressed. Robert Cooper, the archivist of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, believes that the lost mystery play of the masons may survive in the ritual of contemporary masonic lodges.[27]\nFreemasonry In Scotland\nAn early continental history quotes a 16th-century source that by 1535, there were two Scottish masonic lodges recorded in France, one in Paris and the other in Lyon.[39]\nIn Scotland, the lodges of masons were brought under the control of two crown appointed officials, the Warden General and the Principal Master of Work to the Crown, the latter being in existence from 1539 at the latest. Towards the end of the century, William Schaw held both these posts.[26] In 1598, in conference with the masters of lodges in south east Scotland, he produced a set of regulations for the governance of masons and their lodges now known as the Schaw Statutes. These state \"They shall be true to one another and live charitably together as becometh sworn brethren and companions of the Craft.\" They mention wardens, deacons, entered prentices and cowans.[40] The second Schaw statutes, a year later, included in their negotiations a representative of the Lodge of Kilwinning (now Lodge Mother Kilwinning No 0) in Ayrshire, which was assigned jurisdiction over the west of Scotland. Edinburgh became the \"first and principal\" lodge and Kilwinning the \"second and head\" lodge of Scotland, attempting to appease all parties.[27] Since neither the King nor the master of Kilwinning was present, the document was not regarded as final or binding. It was assumed that the King's warrant for the regulations would be obtained.[41]  In 1602, Schaw wrote a Charter granting to Sir William St Clair of Rosslyn the right to purchase patronage over the masons of Scotland. Kilwinning is noticeably absent from the list of lodges appending their endorsement. The charter seems to have lapsed when St Clair fled following a scandal,[27] and a second charter was granted to his son, also William St Clair, in 1628.[42] This patronage was surrendered by their descendant, another William St Clair, on the formation of the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1736,[43] in spite of the fact that it never won the royal approval that would have made it valid.[27]\nEmergence of speculative masonry\nThe lasting effect of the Schaw Statutes arose from the 1599 directive that the lodges should employ a reputable notary as secretary, and that he should record all important transactions. The Scottish lodges began to keep minutes, and therefore the appearance of \"accepted\" or non-operative masons is better recorded than in England, where there are no known internal records of lodge proceedings. \nThe first recorded admission of non-masons was on 3 July 1634 at Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No. 1 , in the persons of Sir Anthony Alexander, his elder brother, Lord Alexander, and Sir Alexander Strachan of Thornton. Sir Anthony was the King's Principal Master of Work, and the man who had effectively blocked the second St Clair charter, the lodges of Scotland being his own responsibility. The reasons that his brother and their friend were also admitted are unclear.[27]\nThe reasons and mechanisms for the transition of masonic lodges from operative communities to speculative fellowships remain elusive. As the responsibility for design shifted from the Master Mason to the architect in the sixteenth century, it is probable that architects started to join the lodges of the masons they worked with.[26] It is also possible that, along with other professional bodies (including the East India Company[44]), operative masonic lodges began to raise money by charging the gentry for admission to their \"mysteries\".[27] Another opinion states that masonic lodges deliberately recruited the rich and powerful in an attempt to improve their pay and working conditions.[30]\nEngland vs Scotland Membership\nWhile lodge records show a gradual development of mixed lodges in Scotland, it is evident that the lodge which initiated Elias Ashmole at Warrington on 16 October 1646 was mainly or entirely composed of speculative or accepted masons.[26] In 1686 Robert Plot's \"Natural History of Staffordshire\" contains a passage about persons of quality being admitted to the society of free-masons, whose history Plot finds invented and ridiculous.[45] At the start of the Grand Lodge period, there appears to have been a predominance of purely speculative lodges in the south of England, with operative and mixed lodges still in the majority in the north and in Scotland.[26]\nIn 1716, four lodges and \"some old Brothers\" met at the Apple Tree Tavern in Covent Garden and agreed to meet again the next year to form a \"Grand Lodge\". These were the Goose and Gridiron, the Crown, the Apple Tree, and the Rummer and Grapes. The \"old Brothers\" were probably from the Cheshire Cheese and at least one other lodge.[26]\nEarly Grand Lodge period\nFirst Grand Lodge\nThe early history of Grand Lodge is uncertain, since no minutes were taken until 1723. It is known that the four lodges mentioned above held an assembly at the Goose and Gridiron, in St Paul's Churchyard, on, 24 June 1717 (the Feast of St John the Baptist). They agreed to restore their \"Quarterly Communications\", four meetings a year for the transaction of masonic business, and an annual assembly to elect the next Grand Master. At this meeting, they elected Anthony Sayer, Master of the lodge at the Apple Tree, of whom little else is known, and the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster was born. At this stage, it is unlikely that they saw themselves as anything more than an association of London lodges. This perception was to change very rapidly.[26]\nThe next year, George Payne became Grand Master. He was a career civil servant with the commissioners of taxes. In 1719, they elected John Theophilus Desaguliers, a clergyman, an eminent scientist, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. The last commoner to serve as Grand Master was George Payne in his second term of office in 1720\/21, when he wrote \"The General Regulations of a Free Mason\" which were later incorporated in Anderson's Constitutions. Thereafter, in what appears to be a deliberate attempt to raise the profile of the organisation, all the Grand Masters have been members of the nobility.[26]\nDesaguliers is often described as the \"father\" of modern freemasonry. It was Desaguliers who inscribed the dedication to Anderson's Constitutions,[4] headed the committee which directed and approved them, and supplied the \"Gothic Constitutions\" from which they were formed. Although he only served one term as Grand Master, he was twice Deputy Grand Master under figurehead Grand Masters, and at other times behaved as if he was Grand Master, forming irregular lodges to conduct initiations. It seems to have been Desaguliers who insisted that ritual be remembered rather than written down, leading to a dearth of material on the development of English ritual until after the formation of United Grand Lodge.[26][46]\nThese considerations cause many masonic historians to see him as the guiding intelligence as the new Grand Lodge embarked on an era of self-publicity, which saw the sudden expansion of speculative masonry, with a corresponding rise in anti-masonic groups and publications. Initiations began to be reported in newspapers. The noble grand masters were often fellows of the Royal Society, but the Duke of Wharton (1722\u201323) had just had his Hell-fire club shut down by the government, and joined, or possibly formed, an anti-masonic group called the Gormagons almost as soon as he left office. From 1721 the installation of the new Grand Master was the occasion for a parade, originally on foot, later in carriages. This became the subject of some ridicule, until starting in 1740 there were also mock processions by anti-masonic groups, leading to the discontinuation of the practice in 1747. The rapid expansion of freemasonry also led to many new lodges failing after only a year or two. In addition to attacks from outside the craft, there were now disillusioned ex-masons willing to make money out of \"exposures\" of freemasonry.[26]\nAnderson's Constitutions\nThe Constitutions of the Free-Masons, \"For the Use of the Lodges\" in London and Westminster, was published in 1723. It was edited by the presbyterian clergyman, James Anderson, to the order of John Theophilus Desaguliers, and approved by a Grand Lodge committee under his control. This work was reprinted in Philadelphia in 1734 by Benjamin Franklin, who was that year elected Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania. It was also translated into Dutch (1736), German (1741), and French (1745).[4]\nAnderson was minister of the Presbyterian church in Swallow Street, London, which had once been Huguenot church, and one of its four Deacons was Desaguliers' father.[47] At the time of his meeting with Desaguliers, he seems to have passed himself off as a Talmudic scholar. His reward for his labours was the copyright on the work. In time, and to Anderson's dismay, it was condensed into \"pocket\" editions over which he had no control and from which he received no income. It was expanded, updated, and re-published in 1738.[27]\nThe historical section, which comprises almost half the book, has already been described. This is followed by the \"Charges\", or general rules for the conduct of Freemasons, and Payne's Regulations, the specific rules by which Grand Lodge and the lodges under its control were to be governed. The ceremony for dedicating a new lodge was briefly outlined, and the work finished with a section of songs.[4] For the first time, the old hand-written charges and constitutions was replaced by an accessible, printed condensation of all there was to being a Freemason, omitting only the ritual. Although the historical section was attacked at the time, and ever since, as being a work of obvious fiction, the work remains a milestone in masonic history.[27] The \"Antient Charges\" published in the current Book of Constitutions of the United Grand Lodge of England have altered little from those originally published by Anderson.[48]\nDegrees and rituals of Freemasonry\nIn common with other trades or mysteries, medieval masonry recognised three grades of craftsman;\u2014 the apprentice, the journeyman, and the master. An apprentice who had learned his craft became a journeyman, qualified to do all manner of masonic work. The master was also qualified as a project manager, often functioning as architect as well. He would sketch the day's work on a tracing board for execution by the journeymen and apprentices.[26] The Schaw Statutes of 1598 show how this had evolved in the lodge system of Scottish masonry. An apprentice, after serving his term of seven years, could elect to pay to join a lodge, becoming an \"entered apprentice\". (Alternatively, he could elect to freelance on the lower grades of building work as a \"Cowan\".) The journeymen were referred to as \"fellows\" or \"fellows of the craft\", which accords with the Regius poem's injunction (line 51) that masons should \"calle other felows by cuthe\". The members of the lodge were \"Brithers\" (brothers), a Scottish legal term for those bound to each other by oath. The Master was simply the mason in charge of the lodge, or one who had held that distinction.[27]\nWhile the swearing of some sort of oath goes back to the earliest records of organised masonry, the first recorded ritual is not until 1696, in the Edinburgh Register House manuscript. From this, and from other documents of the same period, such as the Trinity College, Dublin manuscript of 1711, we can form an idea of the ritual of an operative lodge at the end of the 17th century. On taking of the oath of an Entered Apprentice a mason was entrusted with appropriate signs, a \"Mason's Word\", and a catechism. This was accompanied by much horseplay, which was probably excised as the craft became more gentrified. The fellowcraft was made to take a further oath, and entrusted with two further words and the \"five points of fellowship\", which in 1696 were foot to foot, knee to knee, heart to heart, hand to hand, and ear to ear. The distinction between a fellowcraft and a master is unclear, and in many documents they appear to be synonymous. As accepted masons became initiated, where the various words and signs could no longer be regarded as professional qualifications, the entered apprentice ritual and the fellowcraft\/master were sometimes condensed into one ceremony.[27]\nIn Pritchard's Masonry Dissected, an exposure of masonic ritual written in 1730 by a disillusioned ex-mason, we see for the first time something recognisable as the three degrees of modern Freemasonry.[49] On being admitted to a lodge, a new mason naturally progresses through the degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason. There still remains the rank of Installed Master, which comprises the Master in charge of the lodge and its past masters, and involves its own ritual, words and signs, but entails being elected to take charge of the lodge for a year.[50] These are the regular degrees and ranks of \"craft\" masonry, common to all constitutions. Other, \"higher\" degrees are optional and require a mason to join a side-order, except in lodges constituted under the Grand Lodge of Scotland, which are empowered to confer the Mark Master Mason degree on Master Masons, as an extension to the second or Fellowcraft degree. (see main article, Freemasonry)\nAnderson's 1723 constitutions seem to recognise only the grades of Entered Apprentice, and the Fellowcraft\/Master. Hence the third degree emerged sometime between 1723 and 1730, and took some time to spread within the craft. The fact that it did spread seems to many scholars to indicate that the tri-gradal system was not so much innovation, as the re-organisation of pre-existing material.[26] The Mason word, once given to the Entered Apprentice, was now conferred in the third degree with the five points of fellowship, and the two linked words formerly bestowed on a fellowcraft were split between the first two degrees. The new Master Mason degree was centred on the myth of Hiram Abiff, which itself consists of three parts. The first is the biblical story of the Tyrian artisan with a Northern Israelite mother who became a master craftsman involved in the construction of King Solomon's Temple. The second is the story of his murder by subordinates, which is similar to one of the legends of the French Compagnonnage. Lastly, the story of the finding of his body, and the derivation therefrom of the five points of fellowship, which appears in the Graham Manuscript of 1725, where the body being sought and exhumed is that of Noah.[51] The origin of this re-organisation is unknown. The earliest reference to the conferment of a third degree is from London, from the minutes of \"Philo Musicae et Architecturae Societas Apollini\", a short-lived musical society composed entirely of Freemasons. These minutes record the initiation and passing to the degree of Fellowcraft of Charles Cotton. Then, on 12 May 1725, the society took it upon itself to \"pass\" Brother Cotton and Brother Papillion Ball as Master Masons. This would nowadays be regarded as highly irregular. In March 1726 Gabriel Porterfield received the same degree in lodge Dumbarton Kilwinning in Scotland. That he was not the first is attested by the minutes of the lodge's foundation, only two months earlier, where Apprentices, Fellowcrafts, and Master Masons are recorded as attending. In December 1728, Greenock Kilwinning recorded separate fees for initiation, passing and raising.[52][53]\nSpread of Grand Lodges (1725\u20131750)\n\nEven in London, there were many lodges that never affiliated with the new Grand Lodge. These unaffiliated Masons and their Lodges were referred to as \"Old Masons,\" or \"St John Masons\", and \"St John Lodges\".[54] Nonetheless, the influence of the new central body spread quickly, and the 1725 minutes mention lodges in ten provincial towns as far north as Salford, with Provincial Grand Lodges in South Wales and Cheshire.[26]\nIn the same year, a second Grand Lodge was founded in Ireland, which took several decades to bring all the Irish lodges under its wing. Rival Grand Lodges quickly appeared in Munster and Cork.[55] It was in Ireland that the practice of recognising the regularity of a lodge by the issue of a warrant began, the first known example dating from 1731.[56] The Grand Lodge of Scotland was not formed until 1736.[27]\nAlso in 1725 \"The Ancient and Honourable Society and Fraternity of Freemasons meeting since time immemorial in the City of York\" assumed the title, \" The Grand Lodge of All England meeting in the City of York.\" This should not be interpreted as rivalry, as there was no overlap in the two jurisdictions. Indeed, Anderson's history would have produced the expectation of an older Grand Lodge at York, and the London Lodges were duly furnished with minutes going back some twenty years. Anderson's 1738 Constitutions recognised the independence of \"the Old Lodge of York City. and the Lodges of Scotland, Ireland. France, Italy, etc\".[57]\nHowever, in 1735, the Master and Wardens of an Irish lodge were refused admission to Grand Lodge because they did not have the written authority of the Grand Master of Ireland. It seems that they hoped to be recognised as a deputation from Lord Kingston, then Grand Master of Ireland, and Past Grand Master of the London Grand Lodge. They were offered, and refused, the English authorisation. This has been interpreted as evidence of a split between the two constitutions.[58]\nResponding to the popularity of Pritchard's and other exposures of masonic ritual, Grand Lodge, about this time, made changes to ritual and passwords to make it more difficult for outsiders to pass themselves off as masons. These changes were not universally accepted by affiliated lodges. The Goose and Gridiron (now Lodge of Antiquity No. 2), one of the original and most senior lodges of the constitution, never adopted them. For the unaffiliated, the innovations simply deepened the division. At the time, London was absorbing many economic migrants from Ireland. Those who were already Freemasons felt that they could not work with the new ritual, and the lodges they formed swelled further the numbers of unaffiliated lodges in the capital.[59]\nIn the same period, Freemasonry as practiced by the English, Irish and Scottish lodges began to spread to Europe. The establishment of the first Grand Lodge in France is particularly problematic. Freemasonry itself appears to have been established in France by exiled Jacobites. The Grand Lodge of France dates its foundation to 1728, when it claims the Grand Master was the Duke of Wharton.[60] Some Grand Orient seals date the first Grand Lodge to 1736 (the split between the Grand Lodge and the Grand Orient occurred in 1773).[61] French histories date the first Grand Lodge to 24 June 1738.[62] The situation seems confused, as other histories state that the first legitimate Grand Lodge was formed on 11 December 1743 as \"The English Grand Lodge of France\" with the Count of Clermont as grand master.[63] Although the government of the craft was in the hands of a series of deputies, the protection of the count until his death in 1771 afforded French masonry a period of stability and growth. As masonry was persecuted in other catholic states, the moral and egalitarian nature of the French lodges accorded with the spirit of the age.[64]\nAlthough Anderson seems to imply the existence of an Italian Grand Lodge, no such body existed until the creation of the Grand Orient of Italy in 1805.[65] The first lodge was the English Lodge (\"La Loggia degli Inglesi\") in Florence, founded in 1731,[66] and Freemasonry quickly spread, in spite of a series of Papal bans.[65]\nThe first appearance of the many German Grand Lodges dates from the 1740s, notably \"Of the Three Globes\", founded in Berlin in 1744, which became the \"Grand National Mother Lodge\" in 1772. Frederick the Great became a Freemason while he was still Crown Prince and personally sanctioned the Berlin Lodge.[63] Although a few authors cite the existence of German operative grand lodges as far back as that formed at Cologne Cathedral in 1250,[67] continuity of tradition has been hard to prove, and most sources believe the Eighteenth-century German speculative lodges show descent from the English model.[68][63]\nFreemasonry was brought to the Russian Empire by foreign officers in the Russian service. For instance, James Keith is recorded as being master of a lodge in Saint Petersburg in 1732\u201334.[69] Several years later his cousin John Keith, 3rd Earl of Kintore was appointed Provincial Grand Master of Russia by the Grand Lodge of England.[69] In the early 1770s, Ivan Yelagin succeeded in reorganizing Russian Freemasonry into a far-reaching system that united some 14 lodges and about 400 government officials. He secured English authorization of the first Russian Grand Lodge and became its Provincial Grand Master.[70] Most Russian lodges were attracted to the Swedish Rite. In 1782, Ivan Schwarz represented Russia at the masonic congress in Wilhelmsbad (a health resort in Hanau), where Russia was recognized as the 8th province of the Rite of Strict Observance.[71] See History of Freemasonry in Russia for further details.\nRival Grand Lodges\n\nOn 17 July 1751, representatives of six Lodges gathered at the Turk's Head Tavern, in Greek Street, Soho, London. Five were unaffiliated lodges of mainly Irish membership, and the sixth appears to have been formed shortly beforehand for the business of the evening. On that night, they established the \"Most Ancient and Honourable Society of Free and Accepted Masons according to the Old Constitutions\", now commonly known as the Grand Lodge of the Antients. The first Grand Secretary, John Morgan, obtained a position in the Navy, and resigned after seven months. His successor, Laurence Dermott, presided as Grand Secretary for almost twenty years, being deputy Grand Master on three occasions after that, and exercised considerable influence until his death in 1791.[59]\nDermott's immediate impact was in replacing the regulations that Morgan had written with those of his own lodge in Dublin. In 1756 he published the Antient's own book of constitutions, entitled the \"Ahiman Rezon\", for which no meaning is known. Modeled on Spratt's Irish Constitutions,[72] the regulations are comprehensive and well written, and are followed by an extended section devoted to songs. At the beginning, instead of Anderson's history, is an extended introduction attacking the original Grand Lodge, now calling itself the Grand Lodge of England, but saddled by Dermott with \"the Moderns\" in contrast to the \"Ancient\" usages of the new Grand Lodge. This name remains in use to the present day. His main weapon was satire. He started with an account of how he attempted to write a history which would better the others by describing masonry before Adam, but towards the end of the first volume, he fell asleep. He dreamed of a conversation with Ahimon, one of four sojourners from Jerusalem, about the futility of masonic histories, after which an ancient in a shining breastplate perused his first volume and pronounced, \"Thou hast div'd deep into the water, and hast brought up a potsherd\". He was woken by his neighbour's puppy eating his manuscript. Dermott then proceeded to a reasoned explanation of why a new Mason should not join a \"Moderns\" lodge, since their amended passwords would not be recognised by any of the other Grand Lodges which at that time existed. There follows a humorous account of their \"unconstitutional fopperies\", including Dermott's belief that their greatest masonic symbols were the knife and fork.[73]\nUnder Dermott's influence, penmanship, and oratory, the new Grand Lodge grew to be a serious challenge to the original. The Antient's lodges were warranted from 1752, a practice not taken up by the Moderns for another two decades. As the unaffiliated lodges increasingly saw the sense of belonging to a larger organisation, they usually found that the Antients practice was closer to their own, although it was known for lodges to change allegiance from the Antients to the Moderns. The fact that the practices eventually adopted by the United Grand Lodge largely reflect those of the Antients is attributable to Dermott's industry.[59]\nWhile the emergence of the Antients simply consolidated a division in English Freemasonry, a schism occurred within the Moderns in 1777\/78. While this only involved one lodge, it was the oldest and most prestigious in the constitution, and its Master the Moderns' most respected author and historian. William Preston was already in dispute with the Grand Secretary over the royalties to the new Book of Constitutions he had just written. Some members of his Lodge of Antiquity (formerly the Goose and Gridiron, or the Old Lodge of St Paul's), having attended church as masons, walked back to the lodge in their regalia. Three brethren saw fit to report this to the Moderns Grand Lodge as an unauthorised masonic parade. Preston, the Master of Antiquity, sided with the accused, arguing that since the lodge was one of the original four, it had only subscribed to the original constitutions, and did not require any other authority to hold a parade. For this, he was promptly expelled. Antiquity responded by expelling the three who had complained. At least half of the lodge seceded to the Grand Lodge of All England at York, quoting Article 39 of Payne's regulations, that the Landmarks of the order must be preserved in any new regulations of Grand Lodge (alluding to their own rights and privileges). Antiquity became, for the period of separation, \"the Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent\", warranting at least two lodges in its own right. The dispute was not resolved until May 1789, when Preston and his brethren were received back into the Moderns with much feasting and fanfare.[74]\nA similar situation arose in Scotland. Seniority was assigned according to the dating of lodge minutes, and due to a fire, Kilwinning records started at 1642, somewhat later than the Lodge of St Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. Offended by being recognised as only the second lodge in the constitution, Lodge Mother Kilwinning withdrew from the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1743, and did not rejoin until 1807. During this period, Kilwinning functioned as yet another Grand Lodge, chartering about 70 lodges in Scotland and abroad. While the two Grand Lodges ignored each other at an official level, there does not appear to have been any real animosity, with no bar on masons visiting lodges in the competing jurisdiction. One Kilwinning member became Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland.[75] The Lodge at Melrose, claiming an antiquity at least as great as Kilwinning, simply ignored the Grand Lodge of Scotland, again chartering daughter lodges, with the Master being addressed as \"Grand Master\". They finally joined the national body on 25 February 1891 as The Lodge Of Melrose St John No 1 bis.[76]\nIn the wake of the French Revolution, the British Government became uneasy about possible revolutionary conspiracies. Amongst other repressive measures, Pitt's government proposed to introduce the Unlawful Societies Act in 1799, which declared that any body which administered a secret oath was illegal. Acting quickly, a delegation representing the Ancients, Moderns and the Grand Lodge of Scotland arranged a meeting with the Prime Minister. The delegation included the Duke of Atholl, Grand Master of the Ancients, and Past Grand Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Earl of Moira, Acting Grand Master of the Moderns (the Grand Master being the Prince of Wales). As a result of this meeting, Freemasons were specifically excluded from the act, although lodges were obliged to return a list of members to the local Clerk of the Peace, a practice which continued until 1967. It also demonstrated that the two rival Grand Lodges could act together.[77]\nEstablishment of Freemasonry in North America\n\n\nIn 1733, Henry Price, the Provincial Grand Master over all of North America for the Grand Lodge of England, granted a charter to a group of Boston Freemasons. This lodge was later named St. John's Lodge and was the first duly constituted lodge in America.[78] Between 1733 and 1737 the Grand Lodge in England warranted Provincial Grand Lodges in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. Benjamin Franklin re-issued Anderson's 1723 constitutions as Provincial Grand Master of Pennsylvania.[4] Franklin had written in the Pennsylvania Gazette of 8 December 1730 of the several lodges of freemasons already in the \"province\", joined St. John's Lodge in Philadelphia the following year, and in 1732 was Junior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge of Philadelphia. All this before the \"first\" lodge in North America.[79][80]\nCorrespondence from John Moore, the collector for the port of Philadelphia and himself a Mason, indicate that Masonic Lodges were meeting in Philadelphia in 1715. The present Grand Lodge has the Carmick manuscript, a handwritten copy of the ancient charges dating from 1727, and headed \"The Constitutions of St. John's Lodge\". Colonel Daniel Coxe was made Provincial Grand Master of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania by the Grand Lodge of England in 1730, with effect from 24 June (St. John the Baptist's day) for two years. It is unclear whether he was in America or England at the time, but he was present at Grand Lodge, at the Devil Tavern in London, on 29 January 1731, where he is minuted as Provincial Grand Master of North America. There is no record of his chartering any lodges, but he arranged for St. John's Lodge to double as a Provincial Grand Lodge, and appointed his successor in 1731, a year early. Notwithstanding the acceptance of Coxe as their first Provincial Grand Master, it has been suggested that the formation of the new Grand Lodge by consenting pre-existing lodges makes it a Grand Lodge by \"Immemorial right\", and a sister lodge to the Grand Lodges of England Scotland and Ireland.[81][82]\nNorth America would have many independent lodges in the 18th century. Authorisation, which later would become a Warrant, took time and expense, especially in the period when the nearest Grand Lodge was on the other side of the Atlantic. Many lodges became \"self starters\", and only applied for Grand Lodge authorisation when they were reasonably confident that the lodge would survive for more than a few years. George Washington was initiated into the Lodge of Fredericksburg in 1752.[83] The same lodge was chartered by the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1758.[27] The first properly chartered \"Scottish\" lodge was only two years earlier, being the Lodge of St. Andrews in Boston. Members included Paul Revere and Joseph Warren, and (according to some) later lodge outings included the Boston Tea Party.[80]\nMany lodges were attached British Army regiments. The Moderns may have been wary of warranting lodges without a permanent address, so there was only one Grand Lodge of England warrant in the continental army from 1775\u20131777. The Antients and the Grand Lodge of Scotland were slightly better represented, but the overwhelming majority of regimental lodges held warrants from the Grand Lodge of Ireland.[80] Thus it was that a group of African Americans, having been rejected by the lodges in Boston, were initiated into Lodge No 441 on the register of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was attached to the 38th Foot (later the 1st Staffordshire). These 15 men formed African Lodge No 1, as the British departed, leaving them a permit to do almost everything but admit new masons. Two of the members were seafarers, and obtained entrance to a lodge in London, being recognised as regularly initiated Masons. This enabled their master, Prince Hall, to apply to the Moderns for a charter, which was duly granted on 29 September 1784, now as African Lodge No. 459. Such was the success of the lodge that it became a Provincial Grand Lodge, and Prince Hall the Provincial Grand Master. After his death, the provincial lodges reconstituted themselves as a grand lodge (African Grand Lodge), becoming Prince Hall Grand Lodge in 1847.[84] Around the same time, the history of Freemasonry in Mexico can be traced to at least 1806 when the first Masonic lodge was formally established in the nation.[85]\nRoyal Arch Freemasonry\n\nThe majority of this article deals with craft, or \"blue lodge\" masonry, the three degrees that are common to all masonic lodges and jurisdictions. Further degrees are usually outside of the jurisdiction of Grand Lodges, involve separate ceremonies, and are regulated by different Masonic bodies. The number and names of the \"chivalric\" orders and degrees depend on the local tradition of Freemasonry, and have varied greatly over the years.[27] The oldest of these, and the most universal, is the Royal Arch Chapter (the Holy Royal Arch in England).\nAlthough some masonic writers have attempted to see Royal Arch symbolism in material from the 1720s, the earliest definite reference is to a Royal Arch in a procession in Dublin preceding the master and held aloft by two \"Excellent Masons\". In 1744 it is mentioned as a degree in Dr Dassigny's \"Serious and Impartial Inquiry\".[26]\nLaurence Dermott, the guiding force behind the Ancients Grand Lodge, claimed to have been made a Royal Arch Mason in Dublin in 1746. He referred to it as the fourth degree, and campaigned to have it recognised as such. This happened just after he died, and only twenty years before the union of the Ancients and Moderns. The Moderns, on the other hand, had created a separate Grand Chapter in 1765 to deal with the degree, and wished to keep it separate from pure craft masonry. This would be a point of contention as the two jurisdictions moved towards union. The second of the articles of union stated that there were but three degrees in \"pure Ancient Masonry\", but included the Royal Arch in the third degree. The degree continues to be administered by a separate Grand Chapter, and until a revision in 2004,[86] English Master Masons were simply told that the degree of the Holy Royal Arch completes their third degree.[87][88]\nThe oldest Irish records of the ritual indicate that Royal Arch Chapters originally administered three degrees. The first was based on the refurbishment of the first temple by King Josiah. The second was a short bridge to the third, which was based on the rebuilding of the temple after the exile. Most jurisdictions base the modern Royal Arch ritual on the post-exilic legend. In 1864, the Grand Chapter of Ireland decided to base their ritual on the reign of Josiah, the main practical difference being the names of the officers.[26]\n19th century Freemasonry\nUnion of 1813\nIn 1809, the Grand Lodge of England (the Moderns) set up a \"Lodge of Promulgation\". Its purpose was to \"revert to the Ancient Land Marks of the Society\" and to promulgate those landmarks amongst the brethren. One of its members was the Duke of Sussex, the Master of the Lodge of Antiquity, No 2, and sixth son of George III.[89] The result of their labours was a reply to the Ancients in 1811 that the Grand Lodge had resolved to \"return to the Ancient Landmarks...when it should be ascertained what those ancient landmarks and obligations were.\"  Both Grand Lodges moved visibly towards union, forming committees to negotiate the precise terms. The main sticking point was the inability of the Ancients' committee to decide anything without reporting back to a quarterly meeting of their own Grand Lodge. In October 1812, the Ancients allayed the frustration of the Moderns by granting their commissioners full powers.[90] Shortly after this, the Earl of Moira resigned as acting Grand Master of the Moderns, due to his appointment as Governor General of India. His successor was the Duke of Sussex, who became Grand Master the next January on the resignation of his brother, the Prince of Wales. On 1 December 1813, the Duke of Atholl ceded the leadership of the Ancients to the Duke of Kent, the older brother of Sussex and the father of Queen Victoria. Kent had already presided over the union of the Ancients and Moderns in Canada, accomplished by the brutally simple expedient of merging the lodges of the Moderns with the nearest lodge of the Ancients. The Moderns in Canada had simply ceased to exist.[91] These two men oversaw the union in 1813 to form the United Grand Lodge of England, with the Duke of Sussex appointed as Grand Master of the new body.\nThe actual process of unification continued for some years, first with the Lodge of Reconciliation (1813\u20131816), made up of two lodges, one of each constitution, which ironed out some sort of ritual acceptable to the two parties. The work of this lodge was spread by the Stability Lodge of Instruction (1817) and fleshed out by the Emulation Lodge of Improvement (1823 onwards).[89] The new Grand Lodge essentially ended up with the ritual of the Ancients and the infrastructure of the Moderns. While the \"Emulation Ritual\" became the standard, many variations still exist which, while mutually recognisable, present many flavours of Masonic ritual within the English Constitution.[59]\nMorgan affair and decline in American Freemasonry (1826\u2013c.1850)\n\nIn 1826, William Morgan disappeared from Batavia, New York, after threatening to expose Freemasonry's secrets, causing some to claim that he had been murdered by Masons. What exactly occurred has never been conclusively proven.  However, Morgan's disappearance \u2013 and the minimal punishment received by his kidnappers \u2013 sparked a series of protests against Freemasons throughout the United States, especially in New York and neighboring states. The protracted backlash led to many masons leaving the craft. The Grand Lodge of New York controlled 227 lodges in 1827, but only 41 in 1835.[92]\nUnder the leadership of Thurlow Weed, an anti-Masonic and anti-Andrew Jackson (Jackson was a Mason) movement grew to become the Anti-Masonic Party and made the ballot for the presidency in 1828 while gaining the support of such notable politicians as William H. Seward. Its influence was such that other Jackson rivals, including John Quincy Adams, denounced the Masons. In 1847, Adams wrote a widely distributed book titled Letters on the Masonic Institution that was highly critical of the Masons. In 1832, the party fielded William Wirt as its presidential candidate. This was rather ironic because he was, in fact, a Freemason, and even gave a speech at the Anti-Masonic convention defending the organization. The party only received seven electoral votes. Three years later, the party had disbanded in every state save Pennsylvania, as other issues such as slavery had become the focus of national attention.[93]\nAmerican Freemasons during the Civil War\nThe fortunes of American Freemasonry declined sharply following the Morgan Affair, only to rebound as the force of the Anti-Masonic movement sputtered out in the mid-1830s. By the late 1850s, masonry in America was the subject of renewed popular interest and lodge membership, which had bottomed out during the anti-Masonic period began to rise.  By the time of the American Civil War, U.S. freemasonry tripled its membership from 66,000 to 200,000 members in over 5000 lodges nationwide.  This surge in membership helps explain, at least in part, the many stories of Masonic fraternisation during the American Civil War, which include accounts of Masonic soldiers and sailors rescuing enemy combatants who identified themselves as members of the fraternity.  Masonic incidents are also recorded involving Freemasons burying their own with Masonic formalities during battle, as well as aid and special treatment given to Masonic POWs.[94]\nAfter the Civil War, American Freemasonry flourished along with other fraternal organizations during the so-called \"Golden Age of Fraternalism\" from approximately 1870 to 1920.[95]\nFrance\nIn France, the number of Freemasons grew from 10,000 in 1802, when Napoleon gave it semi-official status, to 20,000 in 1889, 32,000 in 1908, 40,000 in 1926, and about 60,000 in 1936.  At an early stage, nearly all the lodges were affiliated with the Radical party.[96]  Zeldin argues that in 19th century France:\nFreemasonry appealed first of all to people who liked mystic ritual, esoteric symbolism and fancy uniforms, and to those who like to have somewhere to discuss ideas and meet like-minded friends.  Increasingly however it became an organization which politicians used for electoral purposes in which civil servants joined in order to further their chances of promotion, which hotel-keepers found useful as a way of enlarging their clientele and where businessmen could make deals and find jobs for their sons.[97]\nRumors were rife, especially in conservative circles, that the order secretly ran the government, and was the main source of materialistic and anti-clerical propaganda.  Zeldin concludes that was a \"vast exaggeration.\"  The details are known because the Vichy regime in 1941 seized the archives, and failed to find significant evidence. While the order did support anti-clerical campaigns, it did not initiate them.  Its primary role was to serve as a social club which the members could rise in the world, and get 10% discounts in shops owned by fellow Masons.  The chapters provided some charity and life insurance.  In 1904 a scandal erupted because the Grand Orient de France lodges were asked by the Radical government to secretly collect information about the religious and political affiliations of army officers, with a view to blocking the promotion of Catholics. When the news leaked out, the government was forced to resign.  The concern with Radical politics gradually declined, and it disappeared after 1945.[98][99]\nAccording to Ernest Belfort Bax, Freemasons were responsible for the last serious attempt at conciliation between Versailles and the Paris Commune on 21 April 1871. They were received coldly by Adolphe Thiers, who assured them that, though Paris was given over to destruction and slaughter, the law should be enforced, and he kept his word. A few days after they decided, in a public meeting, to plant their banner on the ramparts and throw in their lot with the Commune. On the 29th, accordingly, 10,000 of the brethren met (55 lodges being represented), and marched to the H\u00f4tel de Ville, headed by the Grand Masters in full insignia and the banners of the lodges. Amongst them the new banner of Vincennes was conspicuous, bearing the inscription in red letters on a white ground, \"Love one another.\" A balloon was then sent up, which let fall at intervals, outside Paris, a manifesto of the Freemasons. The procession then wended its way through the boulevards and the Champs Elys\u00e9es to the Arc de Triomphe, where the banners were planted at various points along the ramparts. On seeing the white flag on the Porte Maillot the Versaillese ceased firing, and the commander, himself a Freemason, received a deputation of brethren, and suggested a final appeal to Versailles, which was agreed to. The \"chief of the executive\" hardly listened to the envoys, and declined to further discuss the question of peace with anyone. This last formal challenge having been made and rejected, the Freemasons definitely took their stand as combatants for the Commune.[100]\nGreat Schism\n\nThe schism between French and English Freemasonry is popularly supposed to originate at a general assembly of the Grand Orient de France in September 1877. Accepting a recommendation in a report by a Protestant minister, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Desmons, the assembly, on a majority vote, amended its constitutions to read \"Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity\". The words \"Its principles are the existence of God, the immortality of the soul and human solidarity\" were struck out. The United Grand Lodge of England's (UGLE) response was a resolution in March 1878 that \"That the Grand Lodge, whilst always anxious to receive in the most fraternal spirit the Brethren of any Foreign Grand Lodge whose proceedings are conducted according to the Ancient Landmarks of the Order, of which a belief in T. G. A. O. T. U. (the Great Architect of the Universe) is the first and most important, cannot recognise as \u2018true and genuine\u2019 Brethren any who have been initiated in Lodges which either deny or ignore that belief\". Relations between the two governing bodies effectively ceased, purportedly because the French body had removed the requirement for a belief in a supreme being. However, UGLE had just entered into fraternal relations with the Grand Orient of Belgium, which had removed the Great Architect from its constitutions in 1872, a relationship which lasted until 1921. The reasons for the split are obviously deeper and more complex than the official records suggest.[101]\nMutual distrust between English and French Freemasons was apparent in the 1850s, when French Masonic refugees were appalled at the relationship between UGLE and the Monarchy, aristocracy, and the Anglican church. The English distrusted the mysticism of French Masonry, and its ideals of Fraternity and Universality.[102]\nDesmons' review had been prompted by the Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875. Eleven countries were represented at an attempt to unify the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. An agreement on colonial lodges would have seen the UGLE as the only recognised masonic grand lodge in British colonies, in spite of the Scottish and Irish lodges already flourishing there. The Scottish delegate, Mackersy, who also represented Greece, withdrew. His letter of withdrawal cited his jurisdiction's disagreement with any shift from the requirement for a member to believe in a personal god. He said that he believed the congress would agree to a non-requirement, or the specification of a vague universal principle. In avoiding ratifying a treaty which would obliterate Scottish lodges in the colonies, Mackersy sparked a debate that led to the removal of a requirement for an open volume of scripture in French lodges. The English interpretation of this as a slide towards atheism was probably partly prompted by the difficult political relationship between Britain and France at that time.[103]\nThe gulf between UGLE and GOdF widened due to the French body's active engagement in politics, on a personal and organisational level. All discussion of politics and religion is expressly banned from English lodges.[104]\nLegacy of the Schism\nDuring the First World War, many American lodges relaxed their opposition to the Grand Orient de France to allow servicemen to engage with other masons while in France. Many of these continue to allow their members to associate with continental Freemasons.[104]\nIn December 1913, UGLE recognised a new Grand Lodge in France. The basis of this recognition was the series of obligations that the Independent and Regular National Grand Lodge of France (later the Grande Loge Nationale Fran\u00e7aise) imposed on its lodges. These were:\nWhile the Lodge is at work the Bible will always be open on the altar.\nThe ceremonies will be conducted in strict conformity with the Ritual of the \"Regime Rectifi\u00e9\" which is followed by these Lodges, a Ritual which was drawn up in 1778 and sanctioned in 1782, and with which the Duke of Kent was initiated in 1792.\nThe Lodge will always be opened and closed with invocation and in the name of the Great Architect of the Universe. All the summonses of the Order and of the Lodges will be printed with the symbols of the Great Architect of the Universe.\nNo religious or political discussion will be permitted in the Lodge.\nThe Lodge as such will never take part officially in any political affair but every individual Brother will preserve complete liberty of opinion and action.\nOnly those Brethren who are recognised as true Brethren by the Grand Lodge of England will be received in Lodge.\nThese \"basic principles\" were accepted by UGLE itself in 1929, and written into its constitutions.[101]\nTaxil hoax\n\nBetween the years 1885 and 1897, L\u00e9o Taxil maintained a hoax against both Freemasonry and the Roman Catholic Church, by making increasingly outlandish claims regarding Freemasonry. On 19 April 1897, Taxil called a press conference at which he claimed he would introduce the \"author\" of his books to the press. He instead announced that his revelations about the Freemasons were fictitious.[105] Nevertheless, the material is still used on some anti-Masonic websites today.[106]\n20th century Freemasonry\nFreemasonry under totalitarian regimes (1900\u2013present)\n\nMany twentieth century totalitarian regimes, both Fascist and Communist, have treated Freemasonry as a potential source of opposition due to its secret nature and international connections (not to mention its promotion of religious and political tolerance through its symbolism). It has been alleged by Masonic scholars that the language used by the totalitarian regimes is similar to that used by some modern critics of Freemasonry.[107][108]\nSee also\n\nMasonic manuscripts\nList of Freemasons\nMasonic Appendant Bodies\nScottish Rite\nStonemason\nYork Rite\nNotes\n\nBibliography\nBerger, Joachim: , European History Online, Mainz: Institute of European History, 2010, retrieved: 14 June 2012.\nBullock, Steven C. \"Initiating the enlightenment?: recent scholarship on European freemasonry,\" Eighteenth-Century Life (1996) 20#1 pp.80\u201392 , historiography\nCurl, James Stevens. \"The Art and Architecture of Freemasonry: An Introductory Study (Woodstock, N.Y.: Overlook, 1993)\nDaniel, James W.

A federal statutory holiday, it celebrates the anniversary of July 1, 1867, the effective date of the Constitution Act, 1867 (then called the British North America Act, 1867), which united the three separate colonies of the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into a single Dominion within the British Empire called Canada.[1][2][3] Originally called Dominion Day (French: Le Jour de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration), the holiday was renamed in 1982, the year the Canada Act was passed. Canada Day celebrations take place throughout the country, as well as in various locations around the world, attended by Canadians living abroad.\nCommemoration\nAlthough Canada existed prior to 1867, within both the French and British empires, Canada Day is often informally referred to as \"Canada's birthday\", particularly in the popular press.[4][5][6] However, the term \"birthday\" can be seen as an oversimplification, as Canada Day is the anniversary of only one important national milestone on the way to the country's full independence, namely the joining on July 1, 1867, of the colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into a wider British federation of four provinces (the colony of Canada being divided into the provinces of Ontario and Quebec upon Confederation). Canada became a \"kingdom in its own right\" within the British Empire named the Dominion of Canada.[n 1][8][9][10][11] Although still a British colony, Canada gained an increased level of political control and governance over its own affairs, the British parliament and Cabinet maintaining political control over certain areas, such as foreign affairs, national defence, and constitutional changes. Canada gradually gained increasing independence over the years, notably with the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, until finally becoming completely independent with the passing of the 1982 Constitution Act which served to fully patriate the Canadian constitution.[12]\nUnder the federal Holidays Act,[13] Canada Day is observed on July 1, unless that date falls on a Sunday, in which case July 2 is the statutory holiday. Celebratory events will generally still take place on July 1, even though it is not the legal holiday.[14] If it falls on a weekend, businesses normally closed that day usually dedicate the following Monday as a day off.\nActivities\n\nMost communities across the country will host organized celebrations for Canada Day, typically outdoor public events, such as parades, carnivals, festivals, barbecues, air and maritime shows, fireworks, and free musical concerts,[15] as well as citizenship ceremonies.[16][17] There is no standard mode of celebration for Canada Day; Jennifer Welsh, a professor of International Relations at the University of Oxford, said about this: \"Canada Day, like the country, is endlessly decentralized. There doesn't seem to be a central recipe for how to celebrate it\u2014chalk it up to the nature of the federation.\"[18] However, the locus of the celebrations is the national capital, Ottawa, Ontario, where large concerts and cultural displays are held on Parliament Hill,[19] with the governor general and prime minister typically officiating, though the monarch or another member of the Royal Family may also attend or take the governor general's place.[n 2] Smaller events are mounted in other parks around the city and in neighbouring Gatineau, Quebec.\nGiven the federal nature of the anniversary, celebrating Canada Day can be a cause of friction in the province of Quebec, where the holiday is overshadowed by Quebec's National Holiday, on June 24.[25] For example, the federal government funds Canada Day events at the Old Port of Montreal\u2014an area run by a federal Crown corporation\u2014while the National Holiday parade is a grassroots effort that has been met with pressure to cease, even from federal officials.[26] The nature of the event has also been met with criticism outside of Quebec, such as that given by Ottawa Citizen columnist David Warren, who said in 2007: \"The Canada of the government-funded paper flag-waving and painted faces\u2014the 'new' Canada that is celebrated each year on what is now called 'Canada Day'\u2014has nothing controversially Canadian about it. You could wave a different flag, and choose another face paint, and nothing would be lost.\"[27]\nCanada Day also coincides with Quebec's Moving Day, when many fixed-lease apartment rental terms expire. The bill changing the province's moving day from May 1 to July 1 was introduced by a federalist member of the Quebec National Assembly, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Choquette, in 1973,[28] in order not to affect children still in school in the month of May.[29]\nInternational celebrations\n\nCanadian expatriates will often organize Canada Day activities in their local area on or near the date of the holiday.[30] Examples include Canada D'eh, an annual celebration that takes place on June 30 in Hong Kong, at Lan Kwai Fong, where an estimated attendance of 12,000 was reported in 2008; Canadian Forces' events on bases in Afghanistan;[31][32][33] and in Mexico, at the Royal Canadian Legion in Chapala,[34] and at the Canadian Club in Ajijic.[35] In China, Canada Day celebrations are held at the Bund Beach by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai[36] and at Canadian International School in Beijing by Canada China Business Council.[37]\nHistory\n\n\nThe enactment of the British North America Act, 1867 (today called the Constitution Act, 1867), which confederated Canada, was celebrated on July 1, 1867, with the ringing of the bells at the Cathedral Church of St. James in Toronto and \"bonfires, fireworks and illuminations, excursions, military displays and musical and other entertainments\", as described in contemporary accounts.[38] On June 20 of the following year, Governor General the Viscount Monck issued a royal proclamation asking for Canadians to celebrate the anniversary of Confederation,[39] However, the holiday was not established statutorily until May 15, 1879,[40] when it was designated as Dominion Day, alluding to the reference in the British North America Act to the country as a dominion.[41] The holiday was initially not dominant in the national calendar; any celebrations were mounted by local communities and the governor general hosted a party at Rideau Hall.[38] No larger celebrations were held until 1917 and then none again for a further decade\u2014the golden and diamond anniversaries of Confederation, respectively.[24]\nIn 1946, Phil\u00e9as C\u00f4t\u00e9, a Quebec member of the House of Commons, introduced a private member's bill to rename Dominion Day as Canada Day.[42] The bill was passed quickly by the lower chamber, but was stalled by the Senate, which returned it to the commons with the recommendation that the holiday be renamed The National Holiday of Canada, an amendment that effectively killed the bill.[43]\nBeginning in 1958, the Canadian government began to orchestrate Dominion Day celebrations. That year, then Prime Minister John Diefenbaker requested that Secretary of State Ellen Fairclough put together appropriate events, with a budget of $14,000. Parliament was traditionally in session on July 1, but Fairclough persuaded Diefenbaker and the rest of the federal Cabinet to attend.[38] Official celebrations thereafter consisted usually of Trooping the Colour ceremonies on Parliament Hill in the afternoon and evening, followed by a mass band concert and fireworks display. Fairclough, who became Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, later expanded the bills to include performing folk and ethnic groups. The day also became more casual and family oriented.[38] Canada's centennial in 1967 is often seen as an important milestone in the history of Canadian nationalism and in Canada's maturing as a distinct, independent country, after which Dominion Day became more popular with average Canadians. Into the late 1960s, nationally televised, multi-cultural concerts held in Ottawa were added and the f\u00eate became known as Festival Canada. After 1980, the Canadian government began to promote celebrating Dominion Day beyond the national capital, giving grants and aid to cities across the country to help fund local activities.\nSome Canadians were, by the early 1980s, informally referring to the holiday as Canada Day,[n 3] a practice that caused some controversy:[49] Proponents argued that the name Dominion Day was a holdover from the colonial era, an argument given some impetus by the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982, and others asserted that an alternative was needed as the term does not translate well into French.[44] Conversely, numerous politicians, journalists, and authors, such as Robertson Davies,[50] decried the change at the time and some continue to maintain that it was illegitimate and an unnecessary break with tradition.[44] Others claimed Dominion was widely misunderstood and conservatively inclined commenters saw the change as part of a much larger attempt by Liberals to \"re-brand\" or re-define Canadian history.[44][50][51] Columnist Andrew Cohen called Canada Day a term of \"crushing banality\" and criticized it as \"a renunciation of the past [and] a misreading of history, laden with political correctness and historical ignorance\".[52]\nThe holiday was officially renamed as a result of a private member's bill that was passed through the House of Commons on July 9, 1982, two years after its first reading.[38] Only 12 Members of Parliament were present when the bill was taken up again, eight fewer than the necessary quorum; however, according to parliamentary rules, the quorum is enforceable only at the start of a sitting or when a member calls attention to it.[53] The group passed the bill in five minutes, without debate,[49] inspiring \"grumblings about the underhandedness of the process\".[38] It met with stronger resistance in the Senate. Ernest Manning argued that the rationale for the change was based on a misperception of the name and George McIlraith did not agree with the manner in which the bill was passed, urging the government to proceed in a more \"dignified way\". However, the Senate did eventually pass the bill, regardless.[44] With the granting of Royal Assent, the holiday's name was officially changed to Canada Day on October 27, 1982.\nSince then, lobby groups and politicians have occasionally campaigned to have it returned to Dominion Day.[54] In 1996, Reform Party of Canada MP Stephen Harper introduced a private member's bill to reinstate the name. It was defeated.[54] In 2012, Conservative MP Brad Trost made a speech in the House of Commons advocating for the reinstatement of the Dominion Day name.[54]\nAs the anniversary of Confederation, Dominion Day, and later Canada Day, was the date set for a number of important events, such as the first national radio network hookup by the Canadian National Railway (1927); the inauguration of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's cross-country television broadcast, with Governor General Vincent Massey's Dominion Day speech from Parliament Hill (1958);[38] the flooding of the Saint Lawrence Seaway (1958); the first colour television transmission in Canada (1966); the inauguration of the Order of Canada (1967); and the establishment of \"O Canada\" as the country's national anthem (1980). Other events fell on the same day coincidentally, such as the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916\u2014shortly after which Newfoundland recognized July 1 as Memorial Day to commemorate the Newfoundland Regiment's heavy losses during the battle[55][56]\u2014and the enactment of the Chinese Immigration Act in 1923\u2014leading Chinese-Canadians to refer to July 1 as Humiliation Day and boycott Dominion Day celebrations until the act was repealed in 1947.[57]\nSee also\n\nAnthems and nationalistic songs of Canada\nNational Flag of Canada Day\nPublic holidays in Canada\nCanada 150\nCanada \u2013 Wikipedia book\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"1486c1b6-2ac3-4db6-9309-1425efa87c1b"}
{"question":"How many people have gotten sick from the Armley asbestos disaster?","language":"english","target":{"end_positions":[-1],"passage_indices":[-1],"start_positions":[-1],"yes_no_answer":["NONE"]},"context":["\n\nCoordinates: \n\nThe Camelford water pollution incident involved the accidental contamination of the drinking water supply to the town of Camelford, Cornwall, in July 1988. Twenty tonnes of aluminium sulphate was inadvertently added to the water supply, raising the concentration to 3,000 times the admissible level. As the aluminium sulphate broke down it produced several tonnes of sulphuric acid which \"stripped a cocktail of chemicals from the pipe networks as well as lead and copper piping in people\u2019s homes.\"[1][2] Many people who came into contact with the contaminated water experienced a range of short-term health effects,[3] and many victims suffered long-term effects whose implications remained unclear as of 2012. There has been no rigorous examination or monitoring of the health of the victims since the incident, which is Britain's worst mass poisoning event.[4][5][6] Inquests on people who died many years later found very high levels of aluminium in the brain. Dame Barbara Clayton led a Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution enquiry into the incident.[7]\nImmediately after the contamination the authorities said that the water was safe to drink, possibly with juice to cover the unpleasant taste. In an inquest in 2012 into the death of one of the victims, the coroner stated that South West Water Authority had been \"gambling with as many as 20,000 lives\" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable.[5] In the aftermath of the contamination the public were reassured that there was no risk to health. There were allegations of a cover-up and West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose stated: \"I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident.\"[8] Following an investigation by the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, Michael Meacher, the former Environment Minister, claimed that \"various associated bodies tried to bury the inquiry from the start.\" Meacher told one newspaper: \"This has become a tug of war between the truth and an attempt to silence the truth.\"[9][10]\nAn April 2013 report by the Lowermoor subgroup of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment concluded that exposure to the chemicals was unlikely to cause \"delayed or persistent harm\" and was also unlikely to cause future ill health.[11][12] In September 2013 the government admitted that there had been a \"manifest failure to give prompt appropriate advice and information to affected consumers\" and offered an unreserved apology.[13]\nCause\nOn 6 July 1988, John Stephens, a relief tanker driver working for ISC Chemicals, a Bristol-based subsidiary of Rio Tinto Zinc, arrived at Lowermoor Water Treatment Works on Bodmin Moor and found it unmanned.[14] Being unfamiliar with the location, he had been given a key by another driver and told simply that \"once inside the gate, the aluminium sulphate tank is on the left\". However, the key fitted almost every lock used by the South West Water Authority (SWWA). After twenty minutes looking for the correct tank he tried the key on a manhole cover and when it unlocked believed he had accessed the correct tank.[14] He poured the load of 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate, used to remove solid particles from raw water, into the tank, which actually held treated water prior to distribution to the consumers in Camelford. This immediately contaminated the water supply to 20,000 local people and up to 10,000 tourists.[15][16] The maximum recorded aluminium concentration was 620 milligrams per litre compared with the maximum concentration admissible at the time by the European Community of 0.2 milligrams per litre.[17]\nResponse\nFor several days the water authority insisted the water was safe, and should be mixed with orange juice to disguise the taste of the as yet unknown contaminant. One customer who telephoned the authority the day after the contamination was told \"there had been some acidity, but the water was perfectly safe to drink,\" and was no more harmful than lemon juice.[18] On 14 July 1988 the authority sent a circular letter to all customers \"asserting that the water from the treatment works was of the right alkalinity and was safe to use and drink.\"[19] Within two days, the authority suspected the source of the contamination was the erroneous delivery, which was confirmed on 12 July when the driver was asked to return to the treatment works. However, it was not until ten days later on 22 July that the authority's chairman Keith Court authorised a public notice, containing the first mention of the aluminium sulphate, to be published in the sports section of a local newspaper, the Western Morning News.[20] Stephens stated that after the site meeting where he confirmed he had delivered the chemical to the wrong tank he was told by the authority \"not to mention it to anyone else\".[21] The SWWA district manager, John Lewis, said they had realised within 48 hours that aluminium sulphate was the likely cause of the contamination, but Lewis said he had been instructed by Leslie Nicks, the head of operations, not to tell the public.[22][23]\nDouglas Cross, a consultant biologist based in Camelford, tested the water and found that it contained \"not only aluminium sulphate but other noxious substances, too. As the acidic liquid travelled from the plant into people's homes, it corroded the copper pipes and their soldered joints, made of zinc and lead.\"[1] Official advice to boil the water before drinking was, according to Cross, \"dangerous advice because it concentrates the contaminants. They kept flushing the pipes out for months after the incident. This will have stirred up debris in the bends and only have lengthened the amount of time the water was coming through the taps with all sorts of metals in it.\"\nSixty-thousand (60,000) salmon and trout were killed in the Camel and Allen rivers during the flushing out process.[24][25] The contamination was compounded by the failure of the authority to carry out the required six-monthly cleaning of the tank, which had not been cleaned for three years, leading to a build up of sludge.[26]\nA month after the contamination, Michael Waring at the Department of Health (DH) wrote to every doctor in Cornwall saying that, \"although he had no detailed information on what was exactly in the water or how much people might have drunk, he could assure them that no lasting ill effects would result.\"[27] G.K. Matthews, a senior toxicologist at the DH, suggested a team of medical experts should be sent to the area immediately, but a month later said he had been \"overruled\".[27] The National Union of Public Employees said that the procedure by which the driver had access to the site was common through the region and that they believed this was connected with reduced staffing levels and privatisation plans. They added that they were concerned about the three-week delay in reporting what had happened, and that SWWA district manager John Lewis had been \"instructed at a very high level to say nothing\". Lewis (not a member of the union) had been dismissed; the union said, \"To single him out is unfair.\"[28]\nReports and inquiries\nIn August 1988 a highly critical report by Dr John Lawrence, a senior ICI scientist and non-executive member of the water authority, blamed lax procedures. He also criticised communication failures which kept information from the public.[28]\nLowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report\nThe Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group (LIHAG) was set up in January 1989 to provide expert advice to the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly District Health Authority on the health implications for the population of the Camelford area.[29] In 1989 the LIHAG reported that there was no convincing evidence of a harmful build-up of aluminium and that there was no increase in ill health from poisoned water. A further enquiry by the same group in 1991 acknowledged the affair had caused \"real suffering\" in the community.[30][31] However, Dame Barbara Clayton concluded that this was because of sensational reporting of the incident. She stated that \"In our judgment it is likely that these symptoms would have occurred in the normal course of events,\" and the symptoms were wrongly attributed to the contamination because of \"inaccurate and exaggerated\" claims of health damage by scientists and the news media.[32] When the Clayton report was released in July 1989, it caused \"outrage in Camelford and wide disbelief in the scientific community.\"[33] One section was later amended to read \"alarming statements by pseudo-scientists\" rather than \"...by some scientists\".[33]\nCOT Lowermoor Subgroup report\nIn June 2000 Environment minister Michael Meacher announced that there would not be an independent public inquiry, and declared \"All the facts are fully known and there is no reason to believe that a public inquiry could add to that.\"[34] In November 2000 the Environmental Law Centre  prepared a petition to the European Parliament calling for a Brussels-based inquiry.[35] On 14 August 2001 the government announced that an investigation \u2013 although not a full public inquiry \u2013 into the incident would take place.[36] The investigation was to be undertaken by the newly formed Lowermoor Subgroup (LSG) consisting of scientific and health experts and local resident representatives, chaired by Frank Woods, a professor of medicine at the University of Sheffield.[36] Woods was also the head of the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), of which the Lowermoor team was a subgroup.[37] Its remit was to advise on whether the incident had caused, or was expected to cause, long-term harm to human health and examine whether the existing programme of monitoring and research into the human health effects was sufficient.[38]\n2005 draft report\nA draft report, published on 26 January 2005, was inconclusive, saying that the long-term health effects on the population were still unknown and that there was insufficient scientific information available to determine whether the health problems being experienced were caused by the contamination.[39] Woods called for further studies and said: \"We will be putting the strongest possible case to the minister. I believe carrying out that work is important, it is not something which should be dropped and pushed aside.\"[39]\nThe following year, Meacher made several criticisms of the group:\nthe requirement to examine the DoH's handling of the incident was removed from the terms of reference\nno independent expert on aluminium toxicology was included in the working group\nan attempt was made to include Waring as medical adviser to the group, even though he was the author of the original letter stating that no lasting ill effects would result\nno objective testing of the exposed population was carried out\ntoo much reliance was placed on the water sample analysis from the South-West Water Authority, the compromised party\nthe amount of sludge reported to have been in the contact tank at the time was ignored\nexperts were drawn on who had potentially vested interests in the aluminium industry\nthe DoH pre-released a highly misleading statement of the findings two days before the draft report was due to be made public\nthe executive summary, prepared without the group's approval, and which effectively concluded that the illnesses reported bore no connection with the water poisoning, was \"misleading and biased\".[27]\nTwo members of the LSG committee claimed in December 2007 that the DoH had known from the start that some people were at especially high risk from aluminium poisoning but deliberately suppressed this evidence to protect the government's plans for water privatisation.[40][41]\n2013 final report\nThe final report was published in April 2013, and concluded that it was unlikely that the exposure to chemicals could have caused long-term health problems. Key findings of the report include:\nthere is no evidence that the combination of metals which occurred as a result of the incident could have caused delayed health effects\nthere was an increase in childhood infections in the area, but this increase occurred before the pollution incident\na study of cancer incidence and mortality showed that there was no increase in cancer incidence in the area after the pollution incident\na dermatologist investigated skin and nail problems reported by individuals affected by the incident, and reported that the problems are similar to those experienced by the general population\nthere is no evidence that the contaminants can cause joint or muscle pain and\/or swelling, and these complaints are common in the general population\na Camelford resident who died of severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy was found to have higher than normal aluminium concentrations in the brain during an autopsy. However samples from the brain of a patient with similar neuropathology but unknown aluminium exposure found similar higher than usual concentrations. Research commissioned by the coroner compared 60 postmortem brains and found no correlation between aluminium  or iron concentrations and the level of congophilic angiopathy or senile plaques[11][12]\nHealth effects\nShort-term\nA diverse array of short term health effects was reported by members of the public who either drank the contaminated water or came into contact with it while bathing.[16][28][42] These included:\nurinary complaints,\nblistering and peeling of skin,\nhair turning blue or green,\ndiarrhoea and vomiting, and\njoint pains.\nLong-term\nA 1999 report in the British Medical Journal concluded that some victims had suffered \"considerable damage\" to their brain function.[43] This contradicted the 1991 LIHAG report telling residents that their symptoms were due to anxiety. The study was led by a consultant nephrologist at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and was the first large-scale clinical study of the affected residents. The report stated that their symptoms were similar to those of Alzheimer's disease, which has also been linked with large quantities of aluminium accumulating in the brain.[32] Rejecting the findings of the LIG, the report called for further research to determine the longer term prognosis for the affected individuals and led to fresh calls for a public inquiry into the pollution incident.[44] Although the study was carried out in 1991, its publication was delayed by the ongoing litigation between SWWA and the victims.[45]\nVictims have reported:[31][35][42][46]\nfatigue,\nfibromyalgia,\npremature ageing,\nloss of short-term memory, and\nmultiple chemical sensitivity.\nSeven months after the contamination, one victim underwent a bone biopsy which \"found a ring of aluminium like the rings you see in trees\" that could not have resulted from normal aluminium absorption.[18][27]\nLater deaths of victims\nThe husband of Carol Cross, who died of a rare form of dementia in 2004, said in 2006 that he believed that his wife and twenty other people had died as a result of the disaster, and that more cases were emerging.[16]\nVictim Sarah Sillifant, who was in her twenties when she was exposed, hanged herself in 2005 after suffering dementia and other symptoms similar to those experienced by Carol Cross.[16] In June 2007, Irene Neal, who lived in Rock, near Camelford at the time of the incident, died aged 91. A post-mortem found an \"unacceptable amount of aluminium in the brain\".\nCarol Cross\nIn 2006 a post-mortem inquest into the death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0\u20132 micrograms per gram. Her death was caused by a form of early-onset beta amyloid angiopathy, a cerebro-vascular disease usually associated with Alzheimer's, which could be connected to the abnormally high level of aluminium in her brain.[47][48] Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, said of the findings: \"Further research will be needed before the significance of the elevated brain aluminium concentration in this case can be clarified. A scientific report on the case has been submitted for publication.\"[48] Daniel Perl, of New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine said: \"If additional similar cases were to appear among the 20,000 exposed individuals then the implications of this incident would become extremely important. Only time will tell. At the very least, increased efforts towards surveillance of individuals exposed in Camelford is certainly warranted.\"[49]\nRose had adjourned the inquests for Cross and Neal pending further studies, but in 2008 said the Government had refused \"to either finance or assist\" research to test the hypothesis of a link between exposure to aluminium and congophilic amyloid angiopathy. He said this research was necessary to determine the consequences of the deceased having such a high level of aluminium. He later sought support from Somerset County Council so that the work could go ahead and once more adjourned the inquest into the death of Carol Cross, although Neal's inquest went ahead.[50]\nIn July 2009 Rose announced that the inquest into Cross's death would resume in November 2010.[51] Rose said that \"ongoing medical research would not be completed until late summer\" 2010. He explained \"This research is necessary to prove whether or not the high level of aluminium in Mrs Cross's brain causing her death through beta amyloid angiopathy (a form of cerebrovascular disease) on February 19, 2004, could be attributed to the aluminium sulphate placed in the public water supply at Lowermoor treatment works on July 6, 1988. This is the last adjournment I am able to agree and the inquest will commence on Monday November 1, 2010 at Taunton.\"[51]\nWhen the inquest was reconvened Dr. Chris Exley, a reader in bioinorganic chemistry at Keele University, said \"The brain aluminium concentration was so high that it is highly likely that it contributed to her brain pathology, probably being responsible for the aggressive form and very early onset of the disease.\" Neuropathologist Prof. Margaret Esiri, from the John Radcliffe Hospital, said \"I have never seen a case such as this at this age. I have seen one case in a woman who died aged 81 but the literature shows only a handful of cases worldwide.\"[52] As a result of their evidence the inquest was again adjourned to allow South West Water Authority time to seek its own expert evidence.[53]\nCarol Cross's inquest was finally completed in March 2012. The coroner returned a narrative verdict recording the circumstances without attributing the cause, in which he said the water supply company, South West Water Authority had been \"gambling with as many as 20,000 lives\" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable. An expert said at the inquest that the levels of aluminium in her brain were \"beyond belief\".[5]\nRose stated: \"I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident,\" and that \"[T]he failure of the authority to visit every house after the incident to advise them to thoroughly flush their systems [w]as a serious dereliction of duty. I can say that the incident may either have contributed to or possibly caused Mrs Cross's death, but I do not have sufficient evidence to say so conclusively.\"[54]\nLegal actions against South West Water Authority\nIn 1991 the South West Water Authority was fined \u00a310,000 and ordered to pay \u00a325,000 costs at Exeter Crown Court for supplying water likely to endanger public health. The authority paid at least \u00a3123,000 to settle almost 500 initial compensation claims and in 1997 a further 148 victims accepted out-of-court damages totalling almost \u00a3400,000, approved by a High Court judge sitting in Truro. The settlements ranged from \u00a3680 to \u00a310,000.[25][30][55] Some later claimed they were \"railroaded\" into accepting the out-of-court settlements after being told that their legal aid funding would be withdrawn if they continued with the lawsuit.[3] The judge, Mr Justice Wright, said: \"If the case had been contested, there would have been awesomely complex argument over how much [water] they consumed\" and that they were \"extraordinarily well advised to accept the offer.\"[56] Cross later said: \"The official medical claim from the health authority was that there was no known pathway for aluminium to be absorbed into the body. I would argue that this was a misrepresentation of scientific facts, however it was accepted by the judge [and he] instructed the jury that medical damages could not be awarded. The victims therefore received negligible compensation. This alone is adequate reason for a judicial review, since it resulted in a miscarriage of justice for the victims.\"[1]\nAllegations of a cover-up\nOn 13 December 2007 Michael Rose announced that, in light of \"a possible attempt to initially suppress the seriousness of the incident, I am asking the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall to hand me evidence gathered at the time of the original investigation,\" and for the chief constable to appoint a senior detective \"to look into the allegations of a possible cover-up.\"[57]\nAt the time of the incident the water industry was about to be privatised by the Conservative government of the day; a letter written from a water official to Michael Howard, then Minister of State for Water and Planning, emerged which stated that a police investigation into the poisoning incident was viewed as \"very distracting\" and that any subsequent prosecution of South West Water would also \"be totally unhelpful to privatisation... and render the whole of the water industry unattractive to the City\".[58] The Western Morning News, using a Freedom of Information Act request, uncovered a briefing note to the then Environment Minister, Nicholas Ridley, warning: \"Those of the South West board with a commercial background are deeply concerned by the investigation.\"[59]\nThere was speculation in the news media that commercial concerns were given priority over public health.\nThe former North Cornwall Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) Paul Tyler also uncovered documents contradicting the water authority's claim that it had advised consumers not to drink the water, and that this advice had been given in a radio broadcast at 6am on 7 July 1988 and subsequently. The documents, relating to the prosecution of South West Water, alleged that this \"was not the advice given to the public on the 6th, 7th, 8th, or indeed on the 12th,\" and added that the prosecution would say that the authority \"misled Mr Healey (the head of the drinking water division at the Department of Environment)... There is evidence that a deliberate decision was made to conceal the truth from the public.\"[59] Tyler said \"I can't think of any comparable accident or mistake anywhere in Britain, particularly one involving what was a government agency, where there was no attempt to investigate what went wrong and why.\"[3]\nIn 2001 Environment Minister Michael Meacher claimed that the Government feared what an unrestricted inquiry might find, and that \"There was then a great deal of shenanigans about the terms of reference and fighting at all levels in order to limit the ambit of the committee to get the result they wanted. This inquiry was always potentially hugely damaging and hugely worrying to the establishment in terms of the way they handled the incident and clearly there are elements that want to shut it down.\" No named individuals were ever prosecuted.\nThe national water industry was sold, under the Conservative government, for \u00a33.59 billion, with the sale of South West Water Authority raising around \u00a3300 million.[59]\nSee also\nArmley asbestos disaster\nLove Canal\nSydney Tar Ponds\nCancer Alley\nAbbeystead disaster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],"example_id":"b8102328-8a31-4be6-a7b6-ec3ff419b439"}
