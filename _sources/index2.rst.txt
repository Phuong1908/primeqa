PrimeQA's documentation
=======================

PrimeQA is a public open source repository that enables researchers and developers to train state-of-the-art models for question answering (QA). By using PrimeQA, a researcher can replicate the experiments outlined in a paper published in the latest NLP conference while also enjoying the capability to download pre-trained models (from an online repository) and run them on their own custom data. PrimeQA is built on top of the [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) toolkit and uses [datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/viewer/) and [models](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA) that are directly downloadable.
