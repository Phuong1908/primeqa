### PrimeQA
<h3 align="center">
    <p>The prime repository for state-of-the-art Multilingual and Multimedia Question Answering research and development.</p>
</h3>

PrimeQA is a public open source repository that enables researchers and developers to train state-of-the-art models for question answering (QA). By using PrimeQA, a researcher can replicate the experiments outlined in a paper published in the latest NLP conference while also enjoying the capability to download pre-trained models (from an online repository) and run them on their own custom data. PrimeQA is built on top of the [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) toolkit and uses [datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/viewer/) and [models](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA) that are directly downloadable.


The models within PrimeQA supports End-to-end Question Answering. PrimeQA answers questions via 
- [Information Retrieval](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/ir): Retrieving documents and passages using both traditional (e.g. BM25) and neural (e.g. ColBERT) models
- [Multilingual Machine Reading Comprehension](https://huggingface.co/ibm/tydiqa-primary-task-xlm-roberta-large): Extract and/ or generate answers given the source document or passage.
- [Multilingual Question Generation](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA/mt5-base-tydi-question-generator): Supports generation of questions for effective domain adaptation over [tables](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA/t5-base-table-question-generator) and [multilingual text](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA/mt5-base-tydi-question-generator).

Some examples of models (applicable on benchmark datasets) supported are :
- [Traditional IR with BM25](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/ir/) Pyserini
- [Neural IR with ColBERT](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/ir), DPR (coming soon): to replicate the experiments that [Dr. Decr](https://huggingface.co/ibm/DrDecr_XOR-TyDi_whitebox) (Li et. al, 2022) performed to reach the top of the XOR TyDI leaderboard. Collaboration with [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) IR led by [Chris Potts](https://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/) & [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
- [Machine Reading Comprehension with XLM-R](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/mrc): to replicate the experiments to get to the top of the TyDI leaderboard similar to the performance of the IBM GAAMA system. Coming soon: code to replicate GAAMA's performance on Natural Questions. 
- [Multimedia QA over news & movies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10728): coming soon! to replicate the experiments run over multi-hop QA over images, text over variety of domains. Collaboration with [UIUC Blender lab](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/).

:::{grid-item-card} {fas}`vial` Testing
:link: testing
:link-type: doc
Our goal is that every module and package should have a thorough set of unit tests. 
These tests should exercise the full functionality as well as its robustness 
to erroneous or unexpected input argument.
